1544348166941982720	2022-07-05 15:51:10+00:00	I hear all your comments on believing that this won't be built, you've heard it all before etc.  I agree that this project has been talked about for far too long.  Whether you believe me or not is one thing but I am personally determined to see it built.
1544347581735927809	2022-07-05 15:48:50+00:00	@shanemcdaniel99 @IrishRail @Dept_Transport @merrionstreet @greenparty_ie @Phizzfest @royal_canal @BusConnects @TFIupdates That's a reasonable question Shane. The answer is that the first line of a new system is always the most expensive. Because you have to develop all the underlying engineering and navigation systems etc.  Future expansion of the metrolink will be less expensive

It would be great if it could be built a week from now, but a megaproject like the metro takes time
1539533447265492996	2022-06-22 08:59:11+00:00	@GalHibernia There are dozens of new routes and improvements to be introduced across Ireland later this year as part of the Connecting Ireland programme.

These are large engineering schemes so will take several years to complete.  For interim measures you might contact Dublin City Council
1539532013333520385	2022-06-22 08:53:29+00:00	@Liam220262 Yes, we're designing a Metro, we're designing rail system upgrades, we're designing new Luas lines and extensions. Two BusConnects Corridors have been submitted to ABP and we've increased walking and cycling infrastructure funding to its highest level ever.
1539528984303632385	2022-06-22 08:41:27+00:00	Whilst the process is not immediate, new bus routes and all night trams take planning, and importantly need people to run them.  Remember that even if a new 24 hour route doesn't run to your area, people who take those buses aren't using taxis so there's more available for all.
1539528981384396805	2022-06-22 08:41:26+00:00	With plans to introduce more 24 hour bus routes and increases to frequency on existing 24 hour routes, @TFIupdates are taking steps to enable more night time journeys in Dublin to be made using public transport.
