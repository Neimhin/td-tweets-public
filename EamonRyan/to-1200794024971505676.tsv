I chatted to them in the English market this morning, to hear what have been the critical election issues so far. #wantgreenvotegreen #GE2020  #corksouthcentral #corknorthcentral https://t.co/lwYkJJzLQJ
1224343722441236482	2020-02-03 14:47:45+00:00	I'm convinced Cork City &amp; County will rise as we make a green just transition. With stronger local government building public transport &amp; housing together, local business leading out a healthy food revolution &amp; the Port becoming a new energy hub. #wantgreenvotegreen #Cork #GE2020 https://t.co/psZ7pSExx9
1224037170316443650	2020-02-02 18:29:37+00:00	His top priority is to improve public transport, cycling &amp; pedestrian facilities right across the county. More frequent rail times &amp; better rural bus services is the best way of freeing people from the current gridlock &amp; long commutes. @stevensgreen1 #WantGreenVoteGreen #GE2020 https://t.co/18N8Qtu3Vd

1223262325907558402	2020-01-31 15:10:40+00:00	@unicefireland @greenparty_ie @UReportIRL The solutions to tackle the climate &amp; biodiversity crisis will require us to change everything &amp; we need to make sure it is a change for the better.  More cycling, walking &amp; Public transport, restoring our towns &amp; village communities, healthier food, our own local energy supply.
1223260806827122688	2020-01-31 15:04:38+00:00	@unicefireland @PresWex I think we need to resource the local GP and psychiatric services better and try and get as much early intervention for people at risk.  We have the right health plans in 'Vision for Change' and 'slaintecare' in place, it is now a matter of implementing them properly.
1223258667836944385	2020-01-31 14:56:08+00:00	@unicefireland @PresWex We need to provide more student housing on campus but I'm shocked how much that can sometimes cost. We could bring rents down by scaling up new building methods involving modular designs. We also advocate new cost rental solutions, for everyone including students around town.
1223256632362139650	2020-01-31 14:48:02+00:00	@unicefireland @PresWex We'd start by insulating our social housing stock so people don't have expensive heating bills.  Then provide a better &amp; cheaper public transport system to help those who can't afford a car. Last but not least, I'd give carbon tax revenue back as a dividend, which helps everyone.
1223254663388106753	2020-01-31 14:40:13+00:00	@unicefireland @PresWex For 40 years our party has been advocating for LGBTQI+ rights. I think this measure could be introduced from the design stage as we build new public buildings and upgrade public spaces.
1223253443101503488	2020-01-31 14:35:22+00:00	@unicefireland @PresWex Our policy expects we would need to provide some €90m to fund the initiative which would be administered via GPs and primary health care centres.

1203323621021753349	2019-12-07 14:41:22+00:00	Great conversation about how we promote cycling in our city this morning. We've being saying for 30 years that Dublin could become a great cycling city. In the next ten years I think we could finally make it happen. #ibikeivote #wantgreenvotegreen #Dublin https://t.co/vtPL6K0h64

Very disappointing that @RichardbrutonTD is yielding to legal threats and not proceeding with a wider smokey coal ban. He could do it in conjunction with a phased restriction of wet wood &amp; peat products. https://t.co/KMORcIDRer
1201892812716941314	2019-12-03 15:55:51+00:00	. @BrianLeddin would make a great TD for #Limerick. I think he has a real chance of winning a seat at the upcoming general election. https://t.co/4Nf0pPGPnZ
1200914179386937344	2019-11-30 23:07:06+00:00	We were honoured to have @KarinDubsky on our team. She ran a great first time campaign, from a standing start only a few weeks ago. https://t.co/6kIIDO1UOY
