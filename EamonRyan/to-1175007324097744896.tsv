He originally critisised the comments but his presence yesterday sends a very different message. I think it's valid to question that call.
1199300619317776384	2019-11-26 12:15:24+00:00	.@LeoVaradkar could have stayed away from the Wexford campaign trail yesterday.  Instead by turning up to support Verona Murphy he sends a clear signal that @FineGael tolerates the way she raised fears about refugees, to bolster her own campaign. #shame https://t.co/CromVSisFc

1182648578214420480	2019-10-11 13:26:08+00:00	My suggestion for car pooling facilities in our towns &amp; villages was to give people more options &amp; not to restrict the number of cars. A lot of young people cannot afford to buy a car. This is one way of giving them mobility, without it costing the earth.  https://t.co/yvUhCbUEws
1182639357951430656	2019-10-11 12:49:29+00:00	I have asked @rteliveline to allow me respond on air to the misrepresentation of what I was saying in regard to car pooling.
1182616871289458688	2019-10-11 11:20:08+00:00	@FardeyJ @IrishTimes June. I agree car sharing is more suited to villages and towns rather than more rural areas, which is why I mentioned the village idea in my comments.  Still think we have to look at new local bus services and other mobility solutions as well as the car for those rural areas.
1182616224343216129	2019-10-11 11:17:34+00:00	@EoinPoil @IrishTimes Brendan I agree we need to look at how we can provide better transport solutions for every area including Blacksod.  In many cases the main option will still be by car but that should not stop us looking for other workable solutions to give people choice.
1182614730214727686	2019-10-11 11:11:38+00:00	@ademonkiss Not saying that at all. Everyone will have their own needs and ways of moving around which works best for them.  Just want to give as much choice and low cost solutions as possible.
1182613637783019520	2019-10-11 11:07:17+00:00	@FreelanceWebDev I agree fully and would like to see a whole range of new rural public transport solutions.

I think our response to the climate/biodiversity crisis requires as broad a coalition as possible. That in turn leads me to try and work with whoever the Irish people select as their representatives. Pushing for consensus and more ambition.
1182612356997746690	2019-10-11 11:02:12+00:00	@aoife_kirk I never said you don't need to own a car to live in rural Ireland. I know so many people do have to use one. Nor do I want to demonise people but rather would like rural Ireland to have access to better public transport &amp; some of the new shared mobility services coming on stream.
1182609637427703808	2019-10-11 10:51:24+00:00	@RosemarieMacS @IrishTimes Sorry for the confusion. Tackling our climate &amp; Biodiversity crisis will need everyone &amp; everyplace on board. All of Ireland will have to benefit from the transition. The last thing I want is an urban/rural divide or to undermine the real desire people do have to play their part.
1182607465218740224	2019-10-11 10:42:46+00:00	@donaloflynn @philipnolan1 @GraceOSllvn @MarcKC_Green Donal I'm sorry for the upset caused but think my suggestion is not being accurately reported. I tried to explain it on @OceanFmIreland yesterday. It's not about restricting people or saying you can't have a car but about giving people more options.  https://t.co/yvUhCbUEws
1182602885504425984	2019-10-11 10:24:34+00:00	@paddykell @colettebrowne Very much regret that people were annoyed by the comment but hope I can make it clear that car pooling could provide people more choice rather than restricting anything they do at the moment. I tried to clarify it here on a radio show yesterday:  https://t.co/yvUhCbUEws
1182588220531466240	2019-10-11 09:26:17+00:00	@ismiseleenie @Dogbowl31Medb @IrishTimes I agree, we have to provide more rural public transport. My suggestion for car pooling was to provide other options as well and not to force anyone away from whatever works best for them.  I tried to set out the idea in this radio interview yesterday. https://t.co/yvUhCbUEws
1182586183739674624	2019-10-11 09:18:12+00:00	@RosemarieMacS @IrishTimes I think what I was suggesting has been inaccurately reported. I was promoting car sharing schemes to give people extra options, not to force anyone out from having or using their car.  I tried to correct the record in this interview.  https://t.co/yvUhCbUEws
1182219505516331008	2019-10-10 09:01:09+00:00	@Jackie_HealyRae @cleomurphy64 @kerrytodayrk Jackie, it seems around 1 to every 30 is a ratio that works best elsewhere but remember this isn't about forcing people to do anything but rather giving as much choice as possible &amp; helping people save money. Already starting in urban Ireland, I think rural areas could also gain.
1182200479188766720	2019-10-10 07:45:33+00:00	@gibbsmahon Agreed we need more rural public transport. Car sharing would complement not exclude people having their own cars. Saving people money and giving people who can't afford a car accsss to one when they need it.

1178350670786768896	2019-09-29 16:47:47+00:00	Of 77 water bodies in the Liffey catchment area 48 are at risk of not meeting EU Water Framework Directive objectives. 5 of our transitional and coastal water areas are also at risk. We ignored environmental directives for years &amp; are now paying the price. https://t.co/e1BA27pYJO https://t.co/eWYWQ6aeks
1178350610950819840	2019-09-29 16:47:33+00:00	A beautiful Sunday afternoon but not a soul out on Sandymount strand due to the carpet of brown algae sludge which is covering the beach. It's there because of excess nitrogen &amp; phosphate runoff into the bay from our agriculture &amp; sewerage systems. #dublin https://t.co/DSKwJKC3hO https://t.co/Sre0d3ee0o

1177169433485332480	2019-09-26 10:33:58+00:00	.@SVP_Ireland are right. We have to do a whole range of things, including a massive increase in retrofitting &amp; anti poverty measures. Carbon tax is only one of the climate actions we need to take and refunding all the revenue back is the most appropriate way of protecting people. https://t.co/zHZglSRJSY
1177166572907048962	2019-09-26 10:22:36+00:00	At a Climate Action Committee to consider the impact of rising carbon taxes. @ESRIDublin analysis shows that returning all the revenue to every person via either a social welfare increase or tax credit would undo any regressive impacts and reduce income inequality. #ClimateAction https://t.co/wtxJlbLSYi
1177163571945496576	2019-09-26 10:10:40+00:00	@SenCurran2 Sean Id be happy to give whatever advice I can if you want to contact my dail office via eamon.ryan@oireacthas.ie
1176551162885091328	2019-09-24 17:37:11+00:00	Most importantly we need proper  public consultation &amp; environmental planning so we protect sensitive habitats &amp; maximise community gain. We need full transparency &amp; related marine protected areas to restore bird &amp; sea life. https://t.co/nONdkXirkt @BirdWatchIE @IWEA @NatureNymph
1176551160901189636	2019-09-24 17:37:10+00:00	It won't be possible to balance 70% renewable power in 2030 without more interconnection with our neighbours. The UK will need to do the same. No matter what happens with #brexit I think they'll be involved in regional energy cooperation. https://t.co/54P7d1tIn6 @Energy4Europe
1176551159156367360	2019-09-24 17:37:10+00:00	One big problem is that the return for turbine manufacturers is still a fraction of what oil &amp; gas companies are getting. It's another reason why we must shut those unsustainable exploration business down &amp; use their enginerring skills to build renewables. https://t.co/ZWhoG6bEPp
1176551156878888964	2019-09-24 17:37:09+00:00	Our sea area is ten times our land area &amp; capacity factors are estimated at over 60%, so we've huge potential. @seai are now planning for a floating turbine at their Belmullet grid link test site. If they can survive in those seas, they can work anywhere. https://t.co/evDL2mJOXE
1176551155079536640	2019-09-24 17:37:09+00:00	A key goal will be to develop supply chain jobs in Rosslare, Dublin, Belfast, Moneypoint &amp; Killbegs. The first wind farms are likely to be in the Irish Sea, close to Dublin where the grid is strongest. Longer term we can head South and West to deeper seas. https://t.co/NkcFWRue5T https://t.co/wrjcbdbLPz
1176551149530492931	2019-09-24 17:37:07+00:00	There are over 105 offshore wind farms in EU. New auctions have brought prices down as low as €45 per mwh, while our current wholesale electricity price is €62 mwh. We aim to have 3.5 GW intalled by 2030 but will have competition in getting turbines, as other countries ramp up. https://t.co/FuPh4LyuhW
1176551140831485952	2019-09-24 17:37:05+00:00	I hosted a workshop today with @EUFORES_EU &amp; @Energy4Europe asking how offshore wind can help us meet our energy/climate targets.

1176438869719490561	2019-09-24 10:10:58+00:00	Demand for fossil gas in Europe must decline steeply over next 2 decades, if the EU is to stick to its climate plan. An ongoing over-investment in gas infrastructure means the risk of stranded assets is far bigger than fears about security of supply. https://t.co/vJi0ex7HRz @E3G https://t.co/ybAObl3Nvp
1176436938313740289	2019-09-24 10:03:17+00:00	I welcome @LeoVaradkar decision to stop new Oil exploration licences in our Atlantic waters but it should be extended to all drilling for oil &amp; gas. Gas use has expanded Fourfold since 1990 &amp; is forecast to increase 43% by 2030. This is imcompatible with climate science. @SEAI_ie https://t.co/bq0dc0PQVT
