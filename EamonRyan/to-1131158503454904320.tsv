Inversion of the US bond market 'yield curve' a very strong indicator of a downturn there next year. A 'green new deal' could avert the worst consequences here. https://t.co/hZLYLdXuNL https://t.co/ARLqDvfk6X
1139540936470552576	2019-06-14 14:31:45+00:00	@Pidge @GrainneFallon I'd start with one of his later books  'Invoking Ireland'  because of the glossary at the back which explains so many of the mythological references he uses.
1139474194259951616	2019-06-14 10:06:32+00:00	@GrainneFallon He lost it all in the end in the final weeks of his cancer but gave it to the birds in his garden, who of course used it to make a nest.

Their arguments that local oil &amp; gas  would be cleaner, or would give us energy security make no sense. We need to #KeepItInTheGround #ExtinctionRebellion https://t.co/RbnBpnakeW

It would stop any new oil &amp; gas exploration licences in Irish waters. Climate science says we need to keep 80% of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. #ExtinctionRebellion https://t.co/WON1eDi52J

What he is doing risks all our future. His world view runs counter to everything we stand for. #TrumpInIreland #protest @greenparty_ie #UnitedNations https://t.co/o1uktYgTxJ

She journeyed for years as an eco-warrior and it is time to pack her bags again, as she heads to Brussels &amp; Strasbourg on our behalf. I'm sure she will do us proud. #GreenWave @europeangreens @greenparty_ie https://t.co/iA9GqdZQrI

1134451980724776960	2019-05-31 13:30:03+00:00	My statement to Dail Éireann on the #BiodiversityCrisis. Having lost half of all wildlife in the last 50 years, we need a new understanding of how connected we are to the natural world. Only by changing our ways can we have hope for the future. #Anthropocene #ExtinctionRebelion https://t.co/Pm5A2kGD2m
1134435438205317120	2019-05-31 12:24:19+00:00	We need to leave 80% of already discovered fossil fuel reserves in the ground. Granting more exploration licences in the deep Atlantic makes no sense. We should develop our offshore wind resources instead. #KeepItInTheGround #fossilfree https://t.co/QeolmCu28g
1134129870013980672	2019-05-30 16:10:06+00:00	A Dail majority wants to end new oil &amp; gas exploration in Irish waters but @FineGael is stopping us turning that wish into law. There'll be another protest against this on June 11th next 1pm Kildare St. Be there if you agree with: #KeepItInTheGround #FossilFree #ClimateEmergency https://t.co/NesIWMo3Sc
1134055921796206592	2019-05-30 11:16:16+00:00	There's a protest outside Dail at 1pm today against a Government decision to block the #climateemergency bill, which would put an end to oil and gas exploration in Irish waters. I'm about to ask @RichardbrutonTD his reasons for doing so. Watch live here:  https://t.co/3iwcmIjNXY https://t.co/TWhTHpF3lx
1133401496446558208	2019-05-28 15:55:48+00:00	.@RichardbrutonTD should do some maths: We must keep 4/5ths of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground to avoid a 2°C+ rise. Why then did @FineGael just issue a licence to China Offshore Oil Corp/Exxon Mobile, to drill speculatively off the Kerry coast? https://t.co/PTALZAdlCv https://t.co/idYM12uiMi
1133115502853873665	2019-05-27 20:59:22+00:00	At the Ireland South count #EP2019 @GraceOSllvn has 75,000 votes in the first count. We are quietly confident she may win a seat.
