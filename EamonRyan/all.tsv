Hard to see how that marries with the National Planning Framework objective to concentrate new housing in urban areas. https://t.co/pJKJq3cBiD
1128352756895494145	2019-05-14 17:33:55+00:00	Is the State getting value from the broadband deal? The developer only has a small local team.

Gas use has expanded Fourfold since 1990 &amp; is forecast to increase 43% by 2030. This is imcompatible with climate science. @SEAI_ie https://t.co/bq0dc0PQVT
1176438869719490561	2019-09-24 10:10:58+00:00	Demand for fossil gas in Europe must decline steeply over next 2 decades, if the EU is to stick to its climate plan.

1176551149530492931	2019-09-24 17:37:07+00:00	There are over 105 offshore wind farms in EU. New auctions have brought prices down as low as €45 per mwh, while our current wholesale electricity price is €62 mwh. We aim to have 3.5 GW intalled by 2030 but will have competition in getting turbines, as other countries ramp up. https://t.co/FuPh4LyuhW
1176551155079536640	2019-09-24 17:37:09+00:00	A key goal will be to develop supply chain jobs in Rosslare, Dublin, Belfast, Moneypoint &amp; Killbegs. The first wind farms are likely to be in the Irish Sea, close to Dublin where the grid is strongest. Longer term we can head South and West to deeper seas. https://t.co/NkcFWRue5T https://t.co/wrjcbdbLPz
1176551156878888964	2019-09-24 17:37:09+00:00	Our sea area is ten times our land area &amp; capacity factors are estimated at over 60%, so we've huge potential. @seai are now planning for a floating turbine at their Belmullet grid link test site. If they can survive in those seas, they can work anywhere. https://t.co/evDL2mJOXE
1176551160901189636	2019-09-24 17:37:10+00:00	It won't be possible to balance 70% renewable power in 2030 without more interconnection with our neighbours. The UK will need to do the same. No matter what happens with #brexit I think they'll be involved in regional energy cooperation. https://t.co/54P7d1tIn6 @Energy4Europe
1176551159156367360	2019-09-24 17:37:10+00:00	One big problem is that the return for turbine manufacturers is still a fraction of what oil &amp; gas companies are getting. It's another reason why we must shut those unsustainable exploration business down &amp; use their enginerring skills to build renewables. https://t.co/ZWhoG6bEPp
1176551162885091328	2019-09-24 17:37:11+00:00	Most importantly we need proper  public consultation &amp; environmental planning so we protect sensitive habitats &amp; maximise community gain.

1177169433485332480	2019-09-26 10:33:58+00:00	.@SVP_Ireland are right. We have to do a whole range of things, including a massive increase in retrofitting &amp; anti poverty measures. Carbon tax is only one of the climate actions we need to take and refunding all the revenue back is the most appropriate way of protecting people. https://t.co/zHZglSRJSY

1182200479188766720	2019-10-10 07:45:33+00:00	@gibbsmahon Agreed we need more rural public transport. Car sharing would complement not exclude people having their own cars. Saving people money and giving people who can't afford a car accsss to one when they need it.
1182219505516331008	2019-10-10 09:01:09+00:00	@Jackie_HealyRae @cleomurphy64 @kerrytodayrk Jackie, it seems around 1 to every 30 is a ratio that works best elsewhere but remember this isn't about forcing people to do anything but rather giving as much choice as possible &amp; helping people save money. Already starting in urban Ireland, I think rural areas could also gain.
1182586183739674624	2019-10-11 09:18:12+00:00	@RosemarieMacS @IrishTimes I think what I was suggesting has been inaccurately reported.

I tried to explain it on @OceanFmIreland yesterday. It's not about restricting people or saying you can't have a car but about giving people more options.  https://t.co/yvUhCbUEws
1182609637427703808	2019-10-11 10:51:24+00:00	@RosemarieMacS @IrishTimes Sorry for the confusion. Tackling our climate &amp; Biodiversity crisis will need everyone &amp; everyplace on board. All of Ireland will have to benefit from the transition. The last thing I want is an urban/rural divide or to undermine the real desire people do have to play their part.
1182612356997746690	2019-10-11 11:02:12+00:00	@aoife_kirk I never said you don't need to own a car to live in rural Ireland. I know so many people do have to use one. Nor do I want to demonise people but rather would like rural Ireland to have access to better public transport &amp; some of the new shared mobility services coming on stream.
1182613498565742592	2019-10-11 11:06:44+00:00	@stejmurphy @donaloflynn @philipnolan1 @GraceOSllvn @MarcKC_Green Stephen, I hope you might still join.  I think our response to the climate/biodiversity crisis requires as broad a coalition as possible. That in turn leads me to try and work with whoever the Irish people select as their representatives. Pushing for consensus and more ambition.
1182613637783019520	2019-10-11 11:07:17+00:00	@FreelanceWebDev I agree fully and would like to see a whole range of new rural public transport solutions.
1182614730214727686	2019-10-11 11:11:38+00:00	@ademonkiss Not saying that at all. Everyone will have their own needs and ways of moving around which works best for them.  Just want to give as much choice and low cost solutions as possible.
1182616224343216129	2019-10-11 11:17:34+00:00	@EoinPoil @IrishTimes Brendan I agree we need to look at how we can provide better transport solutions for every area including Blacksod.  In many cases the main option will still be by car but that should not stop us looking for other workable solutions to give people choice.
1182616871289458688	2019-10-11 11:20:08+00:00	@FardeyJ @IrishTimes June. I agree car sharing is more suited to villages and towns rather than more rural areas, which is why I mentioned the village idea in my comments.  Still think we have to look at new local bus services and other mobility solutions as well as the car for those rural areas.

1182648578214420480	2019-10-11 13:26:08+00:00	My suggestion for car pooling facilities in our towns &amp; villages was to give people more options &amp; not to restrict the number of cars.

1223253443101503488	2020-01-31 14:35:22+00:00	@unicefireland @PresWex Our policy expects we would need to provide some €90m to fund the initiative which would be administered via GPs and primary health care centres.
1223254663388106753	2020-01-31 14:40:13+00:00	@unicefireland @PresWex For 40 years our party has been advocating for LGBTQI+ rights. I think this measure could be introduced from the design stage as we build new public buildings and upgrade public spaces.
1223256632362139650	2020-01-31 14:48:02+00:00	@unicefireland @PresWex We'd start by insulating our social housing stock so people don't have expensive heating bills.  Then provide a better &amp; cheaper public transport system to help those who can't afford a car. Last but not least, I'd give carbon tax revenue back as a dividend, which helps everyone.
1223258667836944385	2020-01-31 14:56:08+00:00	@unicefireland @PresWex We need to provide more student housing on campus but I'm shocked how much that can sometimes cost. We could bring rents down by scaling up new building methods involving modular designs. We also advocate new cost rental solutions, for everyone including students around town.
1223260806827122688	2020-01-31 15:04:38+00:00	@unicefireland @PresWex I think we need to resource the local GP and psychiatric services better and try and get as much early intervention for people at risk.  We have the right health plans in 'Vision for Change' and 'slaintecare' in place, it is now a matter of implementing them properly.

We are opening up the country and looking forward to a feeling of normality returning.
1398345836111839234	2021-05-28 18:30:01+00:00	We live on an island - travel and connectivity is important to our economic and social wellbeing.  We need to ensure our important supply chains are resilient. We need to reconnect with our friends and family who live abroad, and welcome tourists back to our beautiful country.
1398345838599053320	2021-05-28 18:30:02+00:00	I promised that by the end of May we would give certainty on the way forward for international travel and today we are doing this.

1398346914052116485	2021-05-28 18:34:18+00:00	This cert comes into effect at EU level on 1 July and countries are being given time to do this - we will take some of this time, it is important to prepare our systems.

1398346915918528514	2021-05-28 18:34:19+00:00	We will also ease the restrictions on non essential travel for third countries in a broadly similar way, including visitors from the US.
1398346920549097482	2021-05-28 18:34:20+00:00	Mandatory hotel quarantine will be retained for what we expect to be a small number of countries and will only be used in relation to variants of concern. However if necessary we will use what is called the Emergency Brake and add more countries to this list if necessary.
1398346919014027275	2021-05-28 18:34:20+00:00	So we will require people arriving from Great Britain to self-quarantine at home unless they have been fully vaccinated. We will keep this under review and I hope later in the summer we will be able to open up further to the Common Travel Area.
1398346922352680960	2021-05-28 18:34:20+00:00	We are looking forward to a really positive summer.

The draft smoky fuel regulations have always been about getting the balance right between tackling fuel poverty and protecting people’s health. https://t.co/KEh8zZNuCA
1518203678397800451	2022-04-24 12:22:18+00:00	The main aim of the draft Solid Fuel Regulations is to end the large scale and commercial sale of smoky fuels into urban areas, not the traditional burning of turf in rural areas.
1518203679794413572	2022-04-24 12:22:18+00:00	Under the regulations, households in small villages and one-off houses would still be allowed to burn turf, or gift or sell a few bags to neighbours.    Misinformation otherwise is scaremongering.
1518203681124069376	2022-04-24 12:22:19+00:00	We will focus on the people who will be affected most by the regulations - in particular low income households who rely on turf as a cheap but inefficient form of fuel with targeted retrofitting and ongoing social welfare supports.

1519267070050979841	2022-04-27 10:47:50+00:00	The consultation held to explore this proposal was the largest ever held by Dublin City Council and shows once again the good that can be achieved when citizens engage with local and national government.

Additionally deliveries by vehicle will still be permitted between the hours 6am and 11am, just like Henry and Grafton Streets, where commerce continues to thrive.

1520055983548125184	2022-04-29 15:02:42+00:00	When the sun shines and there's less wind, solar will be hugely important to our energy generation needs.  There's a misconception that Ireland doesn't have the climate for solar power, but we do have the capability to allow it to supplement our generation during low wind periods https://t.co/2o4eWqN40g
1520055990686826500	2022-04-29 15:02:44+00:00	And I am reliably informed that the odd rain shower helps remove dirt &amp; dust, that can plague solar panels in other climates  We will see even more of these wind and solar plants open around the county and offshore in the coming years to aid our transition to a low carbon society https://t.co/Twnm1cN7Et

1539528984303632385	2022-06-22 08:41:27+00:00	Whilst the process is not immediate, new bus routes and all night trams take planning, and importantly need people to run them.  Remember that even if a new 24 hour route doesn't run to your area, people who take those buses aren't using taxis so there's more available for all.

The answer is that the first line of a new system is always the most expensive. Because you have to develop all the underlying engineering and navigation systems etc.  Future expansion of the metrolink will be less expensive
1544348166941982720	2022-07-05 15:51:10+00:00	I hear all your comments on believing that this won't be built, you've heard it all before etc.  I agree that this project has been talked about for far too long.

From October 31st, the large-scale commercial sale of smoky fuels like smoky coal, turf and wet wood will end.  The sale of Low Smoke Fuels will continue. https://t.co/x7Rj0m5aNn

1547610940924825603	2022-07-14 15:56:16+00:00	Whilst there are benefits for climate action, the reduction in pollution produced by smoky fuels will have a large impact on public health.  As many as 1,400 people a year die from diseases related to pollution. 10 times the number of road deaths  This measure will reduce that.

1609965499303055360	2023-01-02 17:31:01+00:00	An Irish Atlantic Rainforest by ⁦Eoghan Daltun is a great read. It’s a revolutionary call to save us and our natural world from destruction. He argues an ecosystem approach can work best and his ‘re-wilding’ of a West Cork woodland shows what can be done. ⁦@IrishRainforest⁩ https://t.co/vua5EA50ul
1609968576269524997	2023-01-02 17:43:15+00:00	In Donegal the same conditions exist to re-establish temperate rainforests from the tiny fragments of diverse woodlands that remain. A first sign is the presence of plants growing on trees (epiphytes), which rely on moist conditions for their nutrients. ⁦@IrishRainforest⁩ https://t.co/Bx0e1VNBT1
1609971652598665216	2023-01-02 17:55:28+00:00	The challenges are also the same. How do we avoid wild deer or grazing sheep taking every budding sapling, which prevents the forest regenerating &amp; stops the creation of a more diverse ground cover. It’s one of the issues the ongoing national land use review will have to address. https://t.co/PiMNPpTXoj
1609974005003423745	2023-01-02 18:04:49+00:00	And how will we manage Rhododendron and other invasive species, which are crowding out the more biodiverse, carbon intensive temperate rainforest alternative? We need to pay a new generation of farmers &amp; foresters for this vital task, as stewards of our land and natural systems. https://t.co/LOSjQZtk1Q
1609976794727194625	2023-01-02 18:15:54+00:00	Irish forestry will also have to change.
