I remember when we first went onto @DubCityCouncil &amp; helped establish a rainbow coalition, which set the direction of the city for the next five years. Hope we can do the same again now. #wantgreenvotegreen #le19 https://t.co/EyEdWomdiH
1130898022232199169	2019-05-21 18:07:54+00:00	.@Pidge is our candidate in Dublin 8. I may be biased but I think the Dublin suburbs are one of the best places to live in the world. We need to look after them and make them a safe place for children to grow up and thrive. #DublinCanBeHeaven #WantGreenVoteGreen #GreenWave #le19 https://t.co/Re8WevrwQk
1130867879300218880	2019-05-21 16:08:07+00:00	As part of his tour showing how public housing can work well, @CiaranCuffe brought us to Wolfe Tone Close. A high quality, high density, mixed use development, right in the heart of the city centre. #wantgreenvotegreen #greenwave #EP2019 https://t.co/DAeyXn7D63
1130831689448607744	2019-05-21 13:44:19+00:00	Fantastic cycling/walking tour by @CiaranCuffe to see some of the best examples of social housing in Dublin. We were able to build high quality homes during the most difficult of times. No reason we can't do the same now. #DublinCanBeHeavan #WantGreenVoteGreen #GreenWave #EP2019 https://t.co/vCmr1ceSxq
1130786577414807553	2019-05-21 10:45:03+00:00	We've a green mayor @smytho, in #dunlaoghaire, who is one of the most capable politicians I have had the pleasure to meet. I hope we can get a bigger green team on the new council, to plan with real ambition where the county can go from here. #WantGreenVoteGreen #greenwave #le19 https://t.co/k6v0eZlnk5
1130785677313007616	2019-05-21 10:41:29+00:00	.@unapower is our Shankill candidate. We are getting a very good response but success will depend on who votes. In the past only 20% of young voters turned up on the day. If you want a green Ireland, then please make sure you vote on 24th of May. #WantGreenVoteGreen #le19 #EP2019 https://t.co/P7dQ9TCdi5

1130589575993335809	2019-05-20 21:42:14+00:00	Down to Rathfarnham then where @wmpriestley is our candidate. A big question for local politicians is how we improve bus/cycling facilities, without taking out so many trees &amp; front gardens? Can we do so by managing traffic, rather than  widening roads? #WantGreenVoteGreen #le19 https://t.co/acta9SndkD

Caroline has a record of delivering on that for her own local area. I think she has a real chance of winning a green seat. #wantgreenvotegreen #LE19 https://t.co/I88GCXCIJD
1130111468182081536	2019-05-19 14:02:25+00:00	I've seen @CiaranCuffe campaigning on housing, transport &amp; planning issues for over 35 years. He has a vision for a better Dublin and a determination to help deliver it. He would be a brilliant representative for our city in the European Parliament. #wantgreenvotegreen #EP2019 https://t.co/OnbRkwBcIH
1129824709468676101	2019-05-18 19:02:56+00:00	We finished off the day by cycling out to Blackrock for a swim. I spent years bemoaning the lack of safe cycling routes in &amp; around and out of the city. Imagine how wonderful it would be if we built a network of #Galway Greenways. #wantgreenvotegreen #GreenWave #LE19 #ibikeivote https://t.co/8mEHIwA9eR

The Council should have a bigger say in how the city grows from here. We want more of the #Galway that people love. #wantgreenvotegreen  #LE19 #GreenWave https://t.co/fYKr3LVeOV

1129486942989672448	2019-05-17 20:40:46+00:00	Out canvassing with @EvaDowling tonight there were a number of people asking what powers &amp; responsibilities do our local representatives have. Not enough is the answer. We need Councillors who are willing and able to take tough decisions on our behalf.  #WantGreenVoteGreen #LE19 https://t.co/CT4ai5TqBi

1129408128582324227	2019-05-17 15:27:35+00:00	We want greens in the European Parliament because that's where the rules to switch to clean energy &amp; pay farmers for protecting nature are made. That's where funding for good urban development can come from &amp; where the new circular economy is being designed. @CiaranCuffe #EP2019 https://t.co/igd8JjiG7U
1129406939996348418	2019-05-17 15:22:52+00:00	.@LeoVaradkar says the declaration of a climate/biodiversity crisis is just symbolic. He should instead admit his #ProjectIreland40 plan needs to be abandoned and introduce a new one which sets us on a true course to be a net zero emissions island by 2050. @GraceOSllvn #EP2019 https://t.co/mawiAXPudo
1129404883860381696	2019-05-17 15:14:42+00:00	Our message is for the whole country in this election. I think we'll see farming communities voting green in big numbers. They're just as concerned about the future for their children as anyone else. They experience climate change more than anyone else. @saoirse_mchugh #EP2019 https://t.co/Hhjdnob2pM
1129321629417398273	2019-05-17 09:43:52+00:00	We can build cost-rental housing that’s high-quality, close to the centre, delivers for a variety of different people – a mix of people in social &amp; public housing, but at the end of it, we own the asset, not some other private operator. #WantGreenVoteGreen https://t.co/U78ynLYgHt

1128637927091732480	2019-05-15 12:27:05+00:00	A big issue on the doors is the inability of young people to afford housing. The public has lost faith in @FineGael &amp; their ideological reliance on the private market to deliver social housing. We want the land agency to use public lands for 'cost rental' &amp; social housing. #LE19 https://t.co/KNZZVZ3vg6

1128352756895494145	2019-05-14 17:33:55+00:00	Is the State getting value from the broadband deal? The developer only has a small local team. He invests €175 million versus our €3 billion, yet ends up owning the asset. Could the Dept. not manage the roll out itself? Economic competence of @FineGael increasingly questioned. https://t.co/BSdxWQbYZT
1128339533559488514	2019-05-14 16:41:22+00:00	Questioning @RichardbrutonTD; it appears the National Broadband Plan mandates the developer to connect to up to an additional 60,000 new houses in rural Ireland. Hard to see how that marries with the National Planning Framework objective to concentrate new housing in urban areas. https://t.co/pJKJq3cBiD

Politics is an extention of that instinct. It's something to be encouraged and celebrated. #democracy https://t.co/V0dsJzPSd9
1126400306521223169	2019-05-09 08:15:35+00:00	For most candidates it is their friends &amp; family who join them on the campaign trail. @BrianLeddin has a head start, as his mother Kathleen was a former mayor of Limerick city. I think he will make a great new Limerick Leader. #WantGreenVoteGreen #LE19 @greenparty_ie https://t.co/1IzFaAj8KM
