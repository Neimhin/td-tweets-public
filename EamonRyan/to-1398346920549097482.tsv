1403376388955062276	2021-06-11 15:39:39+00:00	Significant progress just now in EU energy council, as we agree a new approach to regulating trans-European energy infrastructure, which excludes EU funding for fossil fuels in projects of common interest. #KeepItInTheGround #ClimateAction  #Fitfor55 #fossilfree #Ten_E https://t.co/XMqT7Z8xrn
1403300059521945601	2021-06-11 10:36:20+00:00	In 2018 the Greens introduced a motion on the promotion of cost-rental housing for our country.  The first homes are now nearing completion in Stepaside.  This is the model for affordable, sustainable, inclusive, and connected, public housing on public land.  #WantGreenVoteGreen https://t.co/t8byziM5PC
1403263602614808577	2021-06-11 08:11:28+00:00	Meeting with Ministers from 10 other countries in advance of EU Energy Council today, who are like minded on excluding fossil fuel infrastructure from Projects of Common Interest status. It could be an important day for our climate if we can agree such a position at the Council. https://t.co/vBrakzyuDl
1403011737918623746	2021-06-10 15:30:39+00:00	CAP reform must deliver for nature and for our farming community.  We have to increase our climate finance support for adaptation and resilience of emerging countries and small island states--not just for Europe.

The new route creates opportunities to remove traffic, trucks and other heavy goods vehicles from towns and villages along the route. https://t.co/qNdVmaiWyP
1402871218676678665	2021-06-10 06:12:17+00:00	While our society begins to recover from the impacts of this pandemic, I am keen to remove as many cost barriers as possible for our SPSV drivers to return to work. This financial package will give operators the consistent support they require into the year 2022. https://t.co/CgBbPnSMBe
1402176657104965632	2021-06-08 08:12:20+00:00	We will make Deposit and Return schemes the norm in Ireland once more. Many of us remember getting paid to return glass bottles to the shop. It's simple, sensible, reduces waste, and keeps resources in circulation as long as possible. #DRSIreland @VOICE_Ireland @CByrneGreen https://t.co/vxm2TPx3pH

Further lifting of restrictions tomorrow will help us all keep that up. https://t.co/ooxGQrsI7k

Claire joining our team in Government will help us deliver better housing, more public transport, longer greenways, &amp; a city where the arts can thrive. https://t.co/ddeI75xjne

Whichever is selected at our convention tonight would make a great TD. The other parties say they want the city to go green. A #1vote green is the way to make it happen. https://t.co/7fVhLBARo4

He was very ambitious but the revolution he sought was in our minds. That's why his idea of opening a new hedge school was so right. https://t.co/s1JohbwfiA

However if necessary we will use what is called the Emergency Brake and add more countries to this list if necessary.
