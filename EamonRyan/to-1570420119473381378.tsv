If the bus operator doesn't offer the discount you might encourage them to sign up to the scheme
1572952985608810504	2022-09-22 14:16:30+00:00	@deckie @ciaraphelan_ As the scheme also covers Commercial Operators who offer child fares but sometimes only to those under 16, this covers students who must travel daily for college to utilise these services and receive the 50% discount.
