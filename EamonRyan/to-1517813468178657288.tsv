1520061889870503936	2022-04-29 15:26:10+00:00	@JoniMacadaHupla @greenparty_ie @NEOEN_Energy @Dept_ECC @ESBNetworks @wicklowcoco @WicklowGreens Moneypoint, our largest Coal power station powers around 1.5 million homes a year.  This plant is more a lot modest and will generate power for around 3,600 homes.
1520055990686826500	2022-04-29 15:02:44+00:00	And I am reliably informed that the odd rain shower helps remove dirt &amp; dust, that can plague solar panels in other climates  We will see even more of these wind and solar plants open around the county and offshore in the coming years to aid our transition to a low carbon society https://t.co/Twnm1cN7Et
1520055983548125184	2022-04-29 15:02:42+00:00	When the sun shines and there's less wind, solar will be hugely important to our energy generation needs.  There's a misconception that Ireland doesn't have the climate for solar power, but we do have the capability to allow it to supplement our generation during low wind periods https://t.co/2o4eWqN40g
1520055975058812928	2022-04-29 15:02:40+00:00	It was particularly lovely to meet the landowners, some of whom's sheep will continue to craze these fields whilst the plant generates power.  It was lovely to meet the Hayes Family, the White Family and Mr. Johnson https://t.co/Irn45tjJRa
1520055964833136641	2022-04-29 15:02:37+00:00	On a beautiful sunny day here in Milltown, County Wicklow we've opened Millvale Solar Farm.  Ireland's largest Solar Generation Plant.  The first of many new sustainable energy generation stations that will begin operations across Ireland in the coming years https://t.co/j4wTkQwSAO
1519739948848623616	2022-04-28 18:06:53+00:00	The burning of solid fuel contributes to 1300 premature deaths every year according a report by the EPA last year.  We know the importance of turf in a practical sense in heating homes but also as a tradition.  But we must act. https://t.co/dB7lLkE69c
1519634745696657408	2022-04-28 11:08:51+00:00	Both Cork and Dublin have selected by @EU_Commission as #MissionCities for the Climate-Neutral Smart Cities Mission 2030.  100 Cities will receive €360 million covering the period 2022-23, to start the innovation paths towards climate neutrality by 2030  https://t.co/c27D25lIbK
1519276071434305536	2022-04-27 11:23:36+00:00	@CunneenKeith @DubCityCouncil Thankfully, more pedestrian space increases footfall, ultimately benefiting commerce.  Additionally deliveries by vehicle will still be permitted between the hours 6am and 11am, just like Henry and Grafton Streets, where commerce continues to thrive.

1519268142224191489	2022-04-27 10:52:06+00:00	If you still remain concerned about impacts that may arise as a result of this new layout, you can continue to engage with the City Council.  The council will be reviewing and monitoring the new layout between now and September when a report will be presented to Councillors
1519267070050979841	2022-04-27 10:47:50+00:00	The consultation held to explore this proposal was the largest ever held by Dublin City Council and shows once again the good that can be achieved when citizens engage with local and national government.  Well done again, and enjoy your new pedestrian space!
1519267066632712194	2022-04-27 10:47:49+00:00	Councillors; including my @greenparty_ie colleague @JanetPHorner, who has championed this proposal from the early stages, this morning voted to enact the proposal  In just 3-4 weeks the vibrant, eclectic and unique street will be traffic free, save for deliveries between 6am-11am https://t.co/nvN2WzDWzZ
1519267062123835394	2022-04-27 10:47:48+00:00	Well done to everyone who engaged so enthusiastically with @DubCityCouncil in the proposals to make #CapelStreet Traffic Free.  91% in favour, including residents and businesses. https://t.co/c4ZH5Yfrr3

1518203681124069376	2022-04-24 12:22:19+00:00	We will focus on the people who will be affected most by the regulations - in particular low income households who rely on turf as a cheap but inefficient form of fuel with targeted retrofitting and ongoing social welfare supports.
1518203679794413572	2022-04-24 12:22:18+00:00	Under the regulations, households in small villages and one-off houses would still be allowed to burn turf, or gift or sell a few bags to neighbours.    Misinformation otherwise is scaremongering.
1518203678397800451	2022-04-24 12:22:18+00:00	The main aim of the draft Solid Fuel Regulations is to end the large scale and commercial sale of smoky fuels into urban areas, not the traditional burning of turf in rural areas.
1518203676330020864	2022-04-24 12:22:17+00:00	Can we wait to let another 1,300 people die or wait for the next trolley crisis before we tackle the large scale sale of smoky fuels?   The draft smoky fuel regulations have always been about getting the balance right between tackling fuel poverty and protecting people’s health. https://t.co/KEh8zZNuCA
1517813468178657288	2022-04-23 10:31:45+00:00	A group of patents, friends and members of https://t.co/GH0EJeACyO are walking the Wicklow Way this weekend, to raise money so young people with autism can take part in social and sporting activities throughout the year. The power of community organisation is something else. https://t.co/hzToNDdagQ
