1447893164157714436	2021-10-12 11:53:25+00:00	@whittledaway @pippa_hackett Yes. We had a very good discussion on the issue at the Environment Council last week. Our national land use plan will be critical to help make sure we get the right trees growing in the right place.
1447511456757452800	2021-10-11 10:36:39+00:00	On Friday, local reps, residents, and officials celebrated the completion of a vital piece of the Dodder Greenway.

1445835070116298752	2021-10-06 19:35:17+00:00	At EUCouncil today there was widespread agreement that the best long term protection from the spike in fossil fuel energy prices is to develop our own renewable power &amp; energy efficiency measures. In the meantime we‚Äôll have to provide upfront measures to help cushion the shock. https://t.co/6vkLLdvaa7
1445340091824709637	2021-10-05 10:48:25+00:00	We need to invest in our cities and bring life back to our towns.  Sustainable transport is the key to high quality, low carbon communities that are a joy to live in.  #NDP2021 will spend twice as much on public transport than on roads &amp; support 1,200 walking &amp; cycling projects. https://t.co/yBIDt6SmQL
