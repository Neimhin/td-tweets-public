I believe the actions in the 2018 Action plan will ensure our Education system continues to build on this success

We must ensure our young people have access to the technologies needed to encourage critical, creative thinking and problem solving skills
960498566266486785	2018-02-05 13:01:18+00:00	As internet safety week begins, I am investing ‚Ç¨30m in ICT equipment for schools. Digital technology can transform the way people learn, encouraging curiosity, exploration and creative thinking.

956874911632551937	2018-01-26 13:02:11+00:00	I'll be on @LunchtimeLiveNT shortly discussing today's announcement to ease pressures for schools finding subs and teachers for certain subjects
956842575935299584	2018-01-26 10:53:42+00:00	Speaking to the media after my @IPPN_Education speech today https://t.co/8z5L6qzbmy
956818384058048512	2018-01-26 09:17:34+00:00	You can read my full announcement regarding teacher supply issues here  https://t.co/uzpJfb0JAC
956817591330361344	2018-01-26 09:14:25+00:00	I am keen that in approaching this issue that we can work with all stakeholders in the best interests of schools and learners.
956811701801889792	2018-01-26 08:51:01+00:00	I will shortly be announcing the establishment of a Teacher Supply Steering Group to consider teacher supply issues at primary and post primary.
956811318232797184	2018-01-26 08:49:29+00:00	The increase in the number of places available on these undergraduate teacher training courses needs to start immediately in critical subject areas.
956811204042870784	2018-01-26 08:49:02+00:00	The undergraduate route to becoming a second level teacher is a very good option for students as it is shorter and less expensive. 5,300 people applied for this adoption last year. I want to double the number of places available.
956810647056023552	2018-01-26 08:46:49+00:00	We are considering how to introduce subject quotas, targeted at areas of shortage, for those undertaking the second level PME
956808634746499073	2018-01-26 08:38:49+00:00	This is not a sustainable approach in the context of our ambitions in STEM, in foreign languages and in digital, and in the context of my overall ambition to have the best education and training service in Europe.
956808519398944768	2018-01-26 08:38:22+00:00	This has not generally been the case at second level where higher education institutions have had autonomy to decide on the enrolment of students seeking to become second level teachers.
956808477271306240	2018-01-26 08:38:12+00:00	Since the foundation of the state my Department has managed teacher supply at primary level. We have controlled the number of courses and the number of places in publicly funded HEIs.
956808143643840514	2018-01-26 08:36:52+00:00	Career break is meant to facilitate personal development, voluntary service overseas, childcare or self-employment.
956807979600359424	2018-01-26 08:36:13+00:00	Purpose of the career break is not to facilitate someone taking another fulltime job, while retaining the right to return to their former teaching job at any point for up to 5 years.
956807836243234817	2018-01-26 08:35:39+00:00	My Department will also issue a note to schools today emphasising that a career break should not be granted unless the school is in a position to fill the temporary vacancy that would be created.
956807314908041216	2018-01-26 08:33:35+00:00	I am today suspending the restrictions regarding substitution limits for those on a career break.  This is a temporary measure which we will keep under review to help schools finding it difficult to find substitutes.
956807010070167552	2018-01-26 08:32:22+00:00	Since 2012/2013, there are 8,900 more teachers working in our schools. No other part of the public service has seen this sort of employment growth in recent years.
956795370117521408	2018-01-26 07:46:07+00:00	I'll be on @morningireland just after 8 speaking ahead of my speech at @IPPN_Education conference
956613976837812225	2018-01-25 19:45:19+00:00	People with jobs will now be eligible for free third level courses https://t.co/8MdtMXjy6Q
956475518949392385	2018-01-25 10:35:08+00:00	All Higher Education providers can submit their proposals for Springboard+ courses here https://t.co/uHZ2Ku2hJq
956475372593393664	2018-01-25 10:34:33+00:00	This change reflects this government's commitment to life long learning and supporting people to continue their education throughout their career
956475116304642048	2018-01-25 10:33:32+00:00	Level 6 courses will continue to be free to all people in receipt of certain allowances, including Jobseekers Benefit
956474958716264448	2018-01-25 10:32:55+00:00	This year for the first time, all Springboard+ courses will be open to everyone irrespective of their employment status.
956474542062489605	2018-01-25 10:31:15+00:00	Springboard+ offers fantastic opportunites for people to upskill or reskill throughout their careers, with courses paid either in full or 90% by the government. 47,000 free higher ed places have been provided to date
956474232476721153	2018-01-25 10:30:02+00:00	Today with @JohnHalligan I am announcing another call for new Springboard+ courses
956189157851848704	2018-01-24 15:37:15+00:00	I was also pleased to negotiate a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers. A teacher graduating this year will start on a salary of nearly ‚Ç¨36,000. By October 2020, a graduate will start on over ‚Ç¨37,600
956188332068950016	2018-01-24 15:33:58+00:00	The numbers graduating from teacher training courses has remained steady over the past few years - this year, nearly 3,500 teachers will graduate from teacher training courses in 2018
956187977654439936	2018-01-24 15:32:33+00:00	Teaching is a very attractive, highly respected career option. We recently announced 3,000 promotional opportunities in schools. These new opportunities will mean that 1 in 3 teachers will now be in leadership positions in our schools
956187206846214145	2018-01-24 15:29:29+00:00	We are very fortunate to have fantastic teachers in Ireland. I'm delighted that more teachers are now staying in Ireland upon graduating than in previous years (73% of undergrads compared to 59% in 2013)
956186710207094785	2018-01-24 15:27:31+00:00	I also accept that some schools are finding it challenging to find teachers in certain subjects. The reasons for this are complex. I have taken some steps already (e.g. expanding the no of places on the Home Ec prog in St. Angela's) &amp; will announce further measures shortly
956185484530724864	2018-01-24 15:22:39+00:00	I've already taken some steps to alleviate pressure on schools such as ensuring, in as far as is possible, that as many retiring and retired teachers remain on the Teaching Council register
956185108209381377	2018-01-24 15:21:09+00:00	I accept some primary schools are experiencing issues with substitution - there are strong career opportunities in teaching &amp; the no of permanent full-time positions are currently increasing at over 1,000 per year - availability of these permanent jobs makes subs less attractive
956184236486201345	2018-01-24 15:17:41+00:00	This reflects the huge emphasis this Government puts on education
956184151912275968	2018-01-24 15:17:21+00:00	8,900 new teaching positions have been created since 2012 - my Department is creating more new teaching positions than at any other period in the history of the state
956183965861339137	2018-01-24 15:16:37+00:00	We have stepped up our recruitment of teachers. Over 5,000 extra teachers (net) have been hired since I was appointed Minister, almost 2,400 in primary schools and just over 2,850 in post primary schools
955382098491334656	2018-01-22 10:10:17+00:00	Will be on @TodaySOR shortly to discuss our review of Career Guidance in schools, universities &amp; further ed and other education matters https://t.co/4xuHgaxD1U
955352427229863937	2018-01-22 08:12:22+00:00	This review will ensure the broader community is proving high quality career guidance support to the next generation
955352274964017152	2018-01-22 08:11:46+00:00	We are fortunate our children have excellent role models, access to exciting emerging sectors and opportunities such as transition year work experience
955352075113783296	2018-01-22 08:10:58+00:00	Employer, higher education institutions, employers and public service providers all have an interest in ensuring our children make good career choices
955351857970536448	2018-01-22 08:10:07+00:00	We've restored 500 guidance posts in schools, but ensuring the next generation make good career choices involves the wider community
955351656165707781	2018-01-22 08:09:19+00:00	We need to ensure that we are providing high quality, relevant career guidance to all students from when they are in school right up to further and higher education
955351338459783169	2018-01-22 08:08:03+00:00	I'm conducting a review of career guidance in schools, universities, IOTs and colleges of further education: https://t.co/TpvBaxOmx6
954396007940358146	2018-01-19 16:51:54+00:00	We must become more climate conscious in the way we live our lives, right down to the little things such as drinking a cup of coffee. I would like to support @yfg on-going #UseYourOwn campaign to urge people to use reusable travel mugs https://t.co/pCgkk1n9n6
953588363914874880	2018-01-17 11:22:37+00:00	To achieve my ambition of having the best Education and Training Service in Europe we must create the best pathways for our students to fulfil their career ambitions and also ensure our education system is equipped to meet the skills needs of enterprise
953586415127982080	2018-01-17 11:14:52+00:00	@itcarlow It is important to listen to people at a local level to hear what we are doing well and what we need to do to achieve my ambition to make our Education and Training Service the best in Europe

953348730941558786	2018-01-16 19:30:24+00:00	The hundreds of new positions being announced today will mean that one in three teachers will be in promoted positions in our schools.
953348115372879873	2018-01-16 19:27:57+00:00	Delighted to announce new promotional opportunities for teachers today. 1300 new leadership posts in post primary schools will build on 1300 new posts at primary. Key changes include the phasing out of seniority as a stand alone criterion for selection.
953270306818478080	2018-01-16 14:18:46+00:00	The changes to the leadership structure in our post primary schools announced today include: 1,300 extra posts for leadership, creating leadership teams in schools and the provision for reporting and regular review.
953269246888423424	2018-01-16 14:14:34+00:00	Today I announced changes to the leadership structure in our schools. The biggest influence on our school going children is the quality of their teachers and the leadership within their school. I have set ambitious targets to improve areas such as: literacy, numeracy, technology
952858749588385792	2018-01-15 11:03:23+00:00	A new funding formula which we are announcing today will link third level funding to the delivery of key national goals, including key skills provision, increasing performance, innovation and lifelong learning
952857921611804672	2018-01-15 11:00:06+00:00	Chairing a meeting of the National Skills Council this morning. https://t.co/j9BRSKeOUo

952852565976408066	2018-01-15 10:38:49+00:00	This will ensure innovation, good governance and excellent research are prioritised by our institutions. These reforms will provide clarity on the expected outcomes for higher education over the next three years and on how funding will be allocated to our institutions
952850990981578752	2018-01-15 10:32:34+00:00	The new competitive fund for innovation will provide extra funding for multi-campus higher education institutes.
