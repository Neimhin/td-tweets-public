Tomorrow (Thursday) I am asking you to give your No.1 to @GeogheganCllr , the best candidate to be a voice in government for Dublin Bay South. https://t.co/C81LAn9RL6
1411982523396206593	2021-07-05 09:37:21+00:00	@BTYSTE is a great competition. I would encourage all schools to apply before Monday 27th September. https://t.co/p5oN9yaVvy

1410935791648481283	2021-07-02 12:18:01+00:00	SF voted against 6,000 homes across Dublin &amp; this week they continued their hypocrisy by voting against the LDA Bill that will deliver affordable homes right across the country.   Stephen Collins: SF hypocrisy on housing a challenge to Government https://t.co/0V7CP7oPdz
1410609405263892489	2021-07-01 14:41:04+00:00	Instead of welcoming the establishment of the LDA, a well-funded state developer with first option on the entire portfolio of state lands, and a mandate to build affordable homes, SF reaches for fake populist slogans and ignores the massive opportunity. https://t.co/hvcqJIob0O
1408384084536090632	2021-06-25 11:18:26+00:00	Well done to @yfg for campaigning in this. https://t.co/mMySU03g8Y
1408381128604536841	2021-06-25 11:06:42+00:00	This report lays bare SF‚Äôs hypocrisy on housing.  SF‚Äôs housing policy is unworkable and will stall progress on this major priority. This is aggravated by their ideological obstruction of projects that would deliver badly needed homes for our community. https://t.co/VAE6Z4QUty

1405164108132065281	2021-06-16 14:03:24+00:00	The ‚ÄòTake, Make, Use, Dispose‚Äô model has got an iron grip on the way we live our lives, and that has to change.  The care of our planet must be at the heart of Project Ireland 2040.   https://t.co/6A5T2E2WHn https://t.co/kOIkGqyNMI
1404832315692531718	2021-06-15 16:04:59+00:00	Young people, particularly students have shown so much reliance during Covid.
