1181552641639354368	2019-10-08 12:51:16+00:00	The ring-fenced funding from Carbon Tax will also be used to fund climate measures, such as: new greenways &amp; urban cycling pathways, pilots for sustainable agricultural measures #Budget2020
1181548995736420352	2019-10-08 12:36:47+00:00	It will create 70 jobs in year one rising to 100 as the programme develops. #Budget2020 #JustTransition
1181548897489043456	2019-10-08 12:36:23+00:00	This programme will support the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) to restore  1,800 hectares of bog in 7 counties, resulting in 28m tonnes of carbon stored over the next 5 years. #Budget2020 #JustTransition
1181548832229924865	2019-10-08 12:36:08+00:00	€5m for bog restoration and rehabilitation which will restore bogs to their natural habitat and become sinks that absorb carbon. #Budget2020 #JustTransition
1181548728311787526	2019-10-08 12:35:43+00:00	This #JustTransition Fund targeted at the Midlands. This funding will support retraining &amp; reskilling workers and assist local communities &amp; businesses in the midlands to transition
1181548536254652416	2019-10-08 12:34:57+00:00	This government is committed to ensuring that the most vulnerable are protected as we move away from fossil fuel. The  #Budget2020 will provide €6m to a Just Transition Fund targeted at the Midlands
1181548466012594183	2019-10-08 12:34:41+00:00	I am acutely aware of the impact that moving away from fossil fuels will have on some people. Just transition and protecting the most vulnerable is at the heart of the Climate Action Plan. #Budget 2020 will support those most affected
1181548389927997442	2019-10-08 12:34:22+00:00	Following Advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council #Budget2020 will increase the price of carbon by €6 per tonne with all money raised ring-fenced for climate action &amp; just transition

1179386588146651138	2019-10-02 13:24:09+00:00	We can also expect consumer prices to come down as operators work in a more competitive market
1179386453434011649	2019-10-02 13:23:37+00:00	The Interconnector is likely to drive down electricity prices for the consumer through increased competition. And because Ireland will be able to join the European Internal Energy market, we can maintain higher levels of wind and renewable energy.
1179386260466610181	2019-10-02 13:22:51+00:00	Once built, its 700 megawatts capacity will power 450,000 households, and help Ireland to switch to 70% renewable energy as set out in the Climate Action Plan
1179386181727002624	2019-10-02 13:22:32+00:00	The €1 billion Celtic Interconnector will connect Ireland’s electricity network to France via an underwater connection
1179386055579127808	2019-10-02 13:22:02+00:00	The government have today confirmed a €530 million investment in the Celtic Interconnector by the European Commission to link Ireland with Europe’s energy grid https://t.co/9H08OvxnIl
1179375163130949634	2019-10-02 12:38:45+00:00	Not only are woodlands crucial to absorb carbon emissions, but they are essential for preserving Ireland’s biodiversity. The focus of this project is on native Irish trees and animal species.
1179375161893642241	2019-10-02 12:38:44+00:00	This project is a great example of how we can better use our resources to step up our response, to what is the most crucial issue of this generation.
1179375158227853312	2019-10-02 12:38:44+00:00	Launching a joint project with @BordnaMona &amp; @coilltenews with @ADoyleTD &amp; @creedcnw that will see bogs no longer used for peat production and transformed into rich, native woodlands.

The government are committed to fully implementing the Goals by 2030.
1174278118288297984	2019-09-18 11:04:55+00:00	The 17 Sustainable Development Goals are an ambitious set of targets, covering the social, economic and environmental requirements for a sustainable future.
1174274877471240192	2019-09-18 10:52:02+00:00	The chosen champions are organisations who are leading by example in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. They will raise public awareness of the Goals, and illustrate practical ways in which organisations and individuals can contribute to achieving the Goals.

1173569530125271046	2019-09-16 12:09:14+00:00	Much of our food waste is avoidable and there is great scope for this to be reduced as well as eliminating plastics that are not recyclable in our food packaging
1173559785565884428	2019-09-16 11:30:31+00:00	Reducing our food waste at each stage of the food chain will result in savings for producers, retails and consumers
1173526931427471360	2019-09-16 09:19:58+00:00	Banning a range of single-use plastics, new fees on non-recyclable plastics, like on food packaging in supermarkets, and halving food waste will be vital to ensuring the Climate Action Plan succeeds. Hosting an important summit today about implementing the change https://t.co/Is3rdPPtUT

This is an important step in our transition away from an electricity sector dependent on fossil fuels to renewable https://t.co/WGYfIb1anq https://t.co/xcPrQU3lWZ
1168788903496753152	2019-09-03 07:32:44+00:00	Delighted to visit St Michael’s House in Coolock which provides important services for people with disabilities. In total we will provide €25m to 57 successful applicants to do energy upgrades - equivalent to taking 11,000 petrol / diesel cars off the road! https://t.co/1eVbvYUM1k
1166993257689243648	2019-08-29 08:37:28+00:00	When we succeed Ireland will be a better place with cleaner air, warmer homes, more resilient enterprises, more secure incomes and jobs and a sustainable relationship with the world around us, that we can proudly pass on to the next generation.
1166992140678905857	2019-08-29 08:33:02+00:00	This is an opportunity to discuss how we can undertake the transition and exploit the new opportunities opened up by our determined aim to lower greenhouse gas emissions and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050
1166991494676393984	2019-08-29 08:30:28+00:00	Industry has a vital role to play in tackling climate disruption
1166989061774630913	2019-08-29 08:20:48+00:00	In Dublin Castle with @HHumphreysFG for our Town Hall on De-Carbonising Business https://t.co/2F7mMqsxz2
1166702809502367744	2019-08-28 13:23:20+00:00	On the Sheehan family farm in Cuffesgrange Co. Kilkenny to discuss the many benefits Smart Farming can provide to all farmers. Farming must continue to harness technology to its advantage by reaping the rewards both in terms of sustainability and farm incomes. https://t.co/IB85NpeD3l
1165929193160527872	2019-08-26 10:09:16+00:00	Increasing the number of on-street charge points will remove a key barrier to the uptake of electric vehicles. In many cases, on-street charge points may be integrated with street lighting in a single lamppost.
1165928804931506176	2019-08-26 10:07:43+00:00	We will also introduce new regulations to require non-domestic buildings with over 20 car parking spaces to install charging points
1165928503977660416	2019-08-26 10:06:31+00:00	I announced today a new scheme to support the roll out of 1,000 electric vehicle charging points by local authorities. One of a number of measures we are taking to support electric vehicle roll out. Builds on Climate Action Fund investment announced earlier this year
1163553137799643141	2019-08-19 20:47:40+00:00	Should be a great event 🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/8IXK6xidxH
1163423123166900224	2019-08-19 12:11:02+00:00	I can assure contractors and home owners that the October deadline to complete retrofitting works will not apply, with completion dates likely to move into 2020 for new grants offered.
1163422848960159744	2019-08-19 12:09:57+00:00	The Task Force will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.
1163422721612668928	2019-08-19 12:09:26+00:00	This new model of retrofitting will be vital to achieve the target set out in the Climate Action Plan to deliver 500,000 homes.
1163422685369688064	2019-08-19 12:09:18+00:00	The new model will group home retrofits in the same area together to reduce costs, develop easy pay back mechanisms like through your electricity bill, and get access to new smart finance and loan options.
1163422516012113921	2019-08-19 12:08:37+00:00	The retrofitting of 500,000 homes, to make them warmer and more energy efficient, is a key action under the Climate Action Plan. These upgrades will help deliver on our climate commitments, which will result in warmer homes &amp; will save homeowners money via cheaper energy bills
1163421783778889730	2019-08-19 12:05:43+00:00	I will be discussing this on @RTENewsAtOne shortly
1163421406589325312	2019-08-19 12:04:13+00:00	Given the huge level of interest in this scheme, I believe that putting applications received on hold while a new review is carried out is not providing enough certainty given the huge amount of work &amp; energy that home owners &amp; contractors have done to get applications in
1163421158500392960	2019-08-19 12:03:14+00:00	Anyone who has submitted an application by the closing date can be assured that their application will be assessed and honoured in line with the existing terms and conditions of the scheme. No work should commence on site until you receive approval to proceed.
1163420824273117184	2019-08-19 12:01:54+00:00	This morning I met with the CEO of @SEAI_ie, Jim Gannon, to discuss the next steps for the deep retrofit pilot scheme. I asked the SEAI to process all applications for the deep retrofit pilot scheme which were received before the July deadline.
1157208356844711936	2019-08-02 08:35:46+00:00	The current provision of free TV licences to those in receipt of the Household Benefits Package will continue. The option of purchasing TV licences at post offices will remain regardless of who the successful awardee of the contract is.
1157208355494084608	2019-08-02 08:35:46+00:00	This is a fundamental reform that will take time to develop, but it will future proof the funding model, taking account of changes in technology and in how content is now consumed.
1157208354160283648	2019-08-02 08:35:46+00:00	It is also clear that due to the nature of technological change and the movement towards digital devices, the design of the T.V. licence fee will have to change.
1157208352876900353	2019-08-02 08:35:45+00:00	Most people pay their T.V. licence fee. However, we still see approximately 12% evasion which we need to address. By tendering for a contract of 5 years, this will allow the awarded body the chance to invest in a robust collection service
1157208351572467712	2019-08-02 08:35:45+00:00	The collection of the T.V. licence fee will be put out to public tender later this year.
1157208347126509569	2019-08-02 08:35:44+00:00	It will allow for the creation of a new funding scheme that would allow the granting of bursaries to journalists in local or community radio stations. We must support our local community radio stations and independent broadcasters.
1157208345704632322	2019-08-02 08:35:44+00:00	Today, I am publishing the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019. This Bill will enable the broadcasting levy to be reduced for all broadcasters and for some community broadcasters to be exempted entirely.
1157208344404381696	2019-08-02 08:35:43+00:00	However, we must recognise that the landscape in which broadcasters operate is undergoing a transformation and that this gives rise to new challenges.
1157208342567301120	2019-08-02 08:35:43+00:00	Public service broadcasting is more important now than ever. Independent, objective reporting of domestic and international affairs is crucial.
1156899927592775680	2019-08-01 12:10:11+00:00	Looking forward to this. Young people have led the way with their passion. We must act now to secure a more sustainable future for the generations which come after us https://t.co/CR2Yx5t700
1154036554983063553	2019-07-24 14:32:10+00:00	This feedback will be taken into account as we develop our 2020 Plan.
1154036553364066304	2019-07-24 14:32:09+00:00	While the focus of the recently published Plan has been on the reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the Advisory Council’s report is a timely reminder that we must also ensure that appropriate consideration is given to embedding robust adaptation measures across the system.
1154036551598239745	2019-07-24 14:32:09+00:00	The intention for the Climate Action Plan is that it is a living, evolving plan that adapts in response to feedback and experience.
1154036549132013569	2019-07-24 14:32:08+00:00	While I recognise that the Council has not yet had the opportunity to evaluate the Plan in full, I am pleased with the Council’s supportive comments following its publication &amp; look forward to their full review &amp; feedback, which will be important for future iterations of the Plan
1154036547534016512	2019-07-24 14:32:08+00:00	The advice of the Council has had a substantial influence on the development of the recently published Climate Action Plan.
1154036545742966784	2019-07-24 14:32:08+00:00	In relation to the publication of the Climate Change Advisory Council’s report, I want to acknowledge the work of the Council in producing this important review
1153977872920567808	2019-07-24 10:38:59+00:00	The time for rhetoric is over. Sustained, consistent action across every sector, driven from the highest level of government is the only way we will meet this challenge. It will define us as a generation #MacGill2019
1153977778540359681	2019-07-24 10:38:36+00:00	We will be living more connected, healthier lives. Our air will be cleaner. Our homes will be warmer.  We will look back at the disposable culture we have now with disbelief. We will have enterprises able to compete and create jobs in a very changed world #MacGill2019
1153977704573800448	2019-07-24 10:38:19+00:00	Ultimately, this is not about our ranking in some European Union or UN league table about ourselves and our children. It is about the resilience of our homes, our farms, our enterprises and our planet for our children and the generation which come after #MacGill2019
1153977609354657792	2019-07-24 10:37:56+00:00	A new toolbox will be required. One that leverages aid, trade, research and compacts in the pursuit of a radical shift towards decarbonization #MacGill2019
1153977446145974279	2019-07-24 10:37:17+00:00	This challenge is also a test of the creative capacity for international cooperation. The European Union must seek to lead the change that is required and our capacity for solidarity will no doubt be crucial in this endeavour #MacGill2019
1153977333130452992	2019-07-24 10:36:50+00:00	To sustain this contract, we will engage in continuous monitoring and open feedback to ensure the policies we have in place are the best ones for our country #MacGill2019
1153977213127188480	2019-07-24 10:36:22+00:00	It is built on three principles: pursuing the policies which offer the least burden &amp; greatest opportunity; recognizing need to support those most exposed &amp; least equipped to meet the challenge and ensuring every section of society make their fair contribution, while govt leads
1153977070051123200	2019-07-24 10:35:48+00:00	This Plan recognizes the balanced nature of the social contract which we need to strike with the Irish public #MacGill2019
1153976881831710720	2019-07-24 10:35:03+00:00	Symbolic gestures will do nothing to solve the climate crisis. There are no silver bullets. Responding to this crisis requires action across the board, led by the government, with structures in place to ensure accountability #MacGill2019
1153976790517538816	2019-07-24 10:34:41+00:00	As we saw with the Action Plan for Jobs, fundamental reform can only be driven by sustained, consistent action. A strong governance framework and oversight to ensure implementation set this Plan apart #MacGill2019
1153976703426994177	2019-07-24 10:34:20+00:00	No new car purchased from that year on, will be fuelled by fossils, compared to 98% that are purchased today. All the plastic in your local supermarket will be fully recyclable. Food waste will be halved. 30% of our homes will be fuelled by renewable heat vs 2% today #MacGill2019
1153976571771990016	2019-07-24 10:33:49+00:00	The Plan envisages radical change. In 2030, we will have 5 times the amount of renewables on our grid that we have today (requiring capacity to peak at 95% electricity generation from renewable sources). 33% of the cars on our road will be fully electric or hybrids (1/2)
1153976435645800448	2019-07-24 10:33:16+00:00	An immediate start must be made because the longer we put off action, the harder it will be and the more irreversible damages will have been done #MacGill2019
1153976329844482048	2019-07-24 10:32:51+00:00	Now, for the first time ever, we know the least cost, least burden roadmap of actions which will ensure we reach our 2030 climate commitments and put us on a trajectory to reach net zero emissions by 2050 #MacGill2019
1153976223120445446	2019-07-24 10:32:26+00:00	Ireland has not been lacking in ambition, but in delivery.  There has been no coherent strategy that would in fact deliver on commitments made.  We cannot countenance another such failure. That is why the government’s Climate Action Plan has taken a completely different approach
1153975894383439872	2019-07-24 10:31:07+00:00	Climate disruption is the biggest challenge facing this generation.  Previously Ireland set a target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. However current forecasts suggest that only a 1% reduction will be delivered. #MacGill2019
1153970823520247808	2019-07-24 10:10:58+00:00	Will be speaking at #MacGill2019 shortly. Extract from my speech can be found here-   https://t.co/VOy8fgOl7g https://t.co/OyaEfuEnuG

1148919286548828160	2019-07-10 11:37:58+00:00	@Lynnie_Nello @CAugustenborg Hi Lynn, thanks for your message. We have set a target to reach 70% renewable electricity by 2030. We will do this through the development of an offshore wind sector, onshore wind and solar power. We will also be removing coal and peat from our electricity generation system.
1148536024022290432	2019-07-09 10:15:01+00:00	Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an air pollutant associated with urban areas, strongly linked with traffic emissions. Diesel vehicles have historically far higher nitrogen dioxide emissions than other combustion engines, especially for older vehicles.
1148535373628346371	2019-07-09 10:12:26+00:00	This underlines the importance of implementing the actions contained in the Climate Action Plan. A new cycling project office and a park and ride office with new 5 year strategies. 180,000 EVs on our roads by 2025. Low emission zones. No new fossil fuel car sold post 2030. https://t.co/YbyvEuBss3

The issues raised by those who made submissions will be considered in the context of drafting heads of bill to bring to government.
1142797072506245120	2019-06-23 14:10:28+00:00	I brought forward proposals for a new Online Safety Law in March. This new law would place clear expectations on social media firms to keep children safe online and would be overseen by a new Online Safety Commissioner
1142140320827793410	2019-06-21 18:40:47+00:00	This plan is about so much more that reaching emissions targets, my Climate Action Plan will create opportunities that will raise people’s living standards such as retrofitting 500,000 homes, installing 600,000 heat pumps in homes &amp; increasing the number of EVs on our roads to 1m
