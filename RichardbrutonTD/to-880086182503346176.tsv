880183298957258754	2017-06-28 21:57:06+00:00	Admission to Schools Bill has just passed Dàil committee stage. Thanks to Oireachtas Education Committee and to all officials
880098482945753088	2017-06-28 16:20:04+00:00	I have come to this decision after extensive consultation on the issue – Oireachtas hearings, over 1,000 written submission &amp; half day forum
880098108243423232	2017-06-28 16:18:35+00:00	I am just setting out my proposed approach at this point, clearly complex legal &amp; constitutional issues are to be worked through
880097837597511680	2017-06-28 16:17:30+00:00	My preference is to remove use religion as criteria in admissions except in only a very small number of schools, of minority religion
880097270989029377	2017-06-28 16:15:15+00:00	I don’t believe parents, who might otherwise not do so, should feel pressure to baptize their children to gain admission to local school
880097180706537474	2017-06-28 16:14:53+00:00	I believe that it is unfair that children of a certain religion who might live some distance away are given preference over local children
880096896056012801	2017-06-28 16:13:46+00:00	This is a very important, complex issue &amp; I believe my preferred option manages to strike a balance btw fairness &amp; protecting min religions
880096746499702786	2017-06-28 16:13:10+00:00	I have set out my preferred option for addressing the role of religion in school admissions this evening
880086251638075392	2017-06-28 15:31:28+00:00	For the first time, we will be explicitly banning discrimination in school admissions
880086182503346176	2017-06-28 15:31:11+00:00	All schools will be required to consult with and inform parents where changes are being made to admissions policies
