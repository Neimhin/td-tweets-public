821002015551721473	2017-01-16 14:31:48+00:00	There are 4 possible approaches for dealing with these issues, in primary schools to begin with.
821002778743107584	2017-01-16 14:34:50+00:00	1) A catchment area approach 2) ‘nearest school rule’ 3) A quota system and 4) prohibition on schools using religion as a factor
821003160877727744	2017-01-16 14:36:21+00:00	To avoid pitfalls &amp; unintended consequences, there will be a short, 10-12-week consultation so I can hear the views of all stakeholders

869110088543457280	2017-05-29 08:36:07+00:00	I believe that it is unfair that preference is given by state funded schools to children of a certain religion over those who live close by

880084732280754184	2017-06-28 15:25:26+00:00	The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill will be at Dáil committee stage this evening, I'll be proposing a number of amendments
880084804527505412	2017-06-28 15:25:43+00:00	This Bill is about fairness and making it easier for parents to enrol their children in a school that meets their needs
880084916687388673	2017-06-28 15:26:09+00:00	It will ensure that where a school is not oversubscribed (around 80% of all schools) it must admit all students applying
880085509678157824	2017-06-28 15:28:31+00:00	We are banning waiting lists. This will end the discrimination against parents who move into a new area
880085707796230144	2017-06-28 15:29:18+00:00	We are explicitly banning fees relating to admissions
880086115062956032	2017-06-28 15:30:55+00:00	Schools must publish their admissions policies, including provisions for pupils who decline to participate in religious instruction
880086182503346176	2017-06-28 15:31:11+00:00	All schools will be required to consult with and inform parents where changes are being made to admissions policies
880086251638075392	2017-06-28 15:31:28+00:00	For the first time, we will be explicitly banning discrimination in school admissions
880096746499702786	2017-06-28 16:13:10+00:00	I have set out my preferred option for addressing the role of religion in school admissions this evening
880096896056012801	2017-06-28 16:13:46+00:00	This is a very important, complex issue &amp; I believe my preferred option manages to strike a balance btw fairness &amp; protecting min religions
880097180706537474	2017-06-28 16:14:53+00:00	I believe that it is unfair that children of a certain religion who might live some distance away are given preference over local children
880097270989029377	2017-06-28 16:15:15+00:00	I don’t believe parents, who might otherwise not do so, should feel pressure to baptize their children to gain admission to local school
880097837597511680	2017-06-28 16:17:30+00:00	My preference is to remove use religion as criteria in admissions except in only a very small number of schools, of minority religion
880098108243423232	2017-06-28 16:18:35+00:00	I am just setting out my proposed approach at this point, clearly complex legal &amp; constitutional issues are to be worked through
880098482945753088	2017-06-28 16:20:04+00:00	I have come to this decision after extensive consultation on the issue – Oireachtas hearings, over 1,000 written submission &amp; half day forum
880183298957258754	2017-06-28 21:57:06+00:00	Admission to Schools Bill has just passed Dàil committee stage. Thanks to Oireachtas Education Committee and to all officials
881064611507777536	2017-07-01 08:19:07+00:00	I have an op-ed in the @Independent_ie today on the role of religion in school admissions &amp; the importance of balance on this complex issue https://t.co/bVHDCbexdk
881080083603181568	2017-07-01 09:20:36+00:00	My article sets out why we must carefully balance rights of catholic, those of min religions e.g. church of Ireland &amp; non religious parents
881080633140838400	2017-07-01 09:22:47+00:00	Under my proposal, min religion schools are able to protect ethos, catholics can educate thru faith &amp; non religious can access local school
881080946128191489	2017-07-01 09:24:01+00:00	"There is no ""silver bullet"" solution here, it is my job as min for education to ensure the rights of all are protected in best possible way"
881082171380944896	2017-07-01 09:28:54+00:00	@HanrahanAndy @cslireland @Independent_ie Hi Andy, SNA allocations will be released very shortly. Richard
881084396408905728	2017-07-01 09:37:44+00:00	@PaulaKearns3 @Independent_ie thanks Paula, yes all minority religions would receive the same protections under my proposal
881098033383055360	2017-07-01 10:31:55+00:00	@Murphynikkijune @Independent_ie hi Nikki, no that is not part of my proposal

953586415127982080	2018-01-17 11:14:52+00:00	@itcarlow It is important to listen to people at a local level to hear what we are doing well and what we need to do to achieve my ambition to make our Education and Training Service the best in Europe
953588363914874880	2018-01-17 11:22:37+00:00	To achieve my ambition of having the best Education and Training Service in Europe we must create the best pathways for our students to fulfil their career ambitions and also ensure our education system is equipped to meet the skills needs of enterprise
954396007940358146	2018-01-19 16:51:54+00:00	We must become more climate conscious in the way we live our lives, right down to the little things such as drinking a cup of coffee. I would like to support @yfg on-going #UseYourOwn campaign to urge people to use reusable travel mugs https://t.co/pCgkk1n9n6
955351338459783169	2018-01-22 08:08:03+00:00	I'm conducting a review of career guidance in schools, universities, IOTs and colleges of further education: https://t.co/TpvBaxOmx6
955351656165707781	2018-01-22 08:09:19+00:00	We need to ensure that we are providing high quality, relevant career guidance to all students from when they are in school right up to further and higher education
955351857970536448	2018-01-22 08:10:07+00:00	We've restored 500 guidance posts in schools, but ensuring the next generation make good career choices involves the wider community
955352075113783296	2018-01-22 08:10:58+00:00	Employer, higher education institutions, employers and public service providers all have an interest in ensuring our children make good career choices
955352274964017152	2018-01-22 08:11:46+00:00	We are fortunate our children have excellent role models, access to exciting emerging sectors and opportunities such as transition year work experience
955352427229863937	2018-01-22 08:12:22+00:00	This review will ensure the broader community is proving high quality career guidance support to the next generation
955382098491334656	2018-01-22 10:10:17+00:00	Will be on @TodaySOR shortly to discuss our review of Career Guidance in schools, universities &amp; further ed and other education matters https://t.co/4xuHgaxD1U
956183965861339137	2018-01-24 15:16:37+00:00	We have stepped up our recruitment of teachers. Over 5,000 extra teachers (net) have been hired since I was appointed Minister, almost 2,400 in primary schools and just over 2,850 in post primary schools
956184151912275968	2018-01-24 15:17:21+00:00	8,900 new teaching positions have been created since 2012 - my Department is creating more new teaching positions than at any other period in the history of the state
956184236486201345	2018-01-24 15:17:41+00:00	This reflects the huge emphasis this Government puts on education
956185108209381377	2018-01-24 15:21:09+00:00	I accept some primary schools are experiencing issues with substitution - there are strong career opportunities in teaching &amp; the no of permanent full-time positions are currently increasing at over 1,000 per year - availability of these permanent jobs makes subs less attractive
956185484530724864	2018-01-24 15:22:39+00:00	I've already taken some steps to alleviate pressure on schools such as ensuring, in as far as is possible, that as many retiring and retired teachers remain on the Teaching Council register
956186710207094785	2018-01-24 15:27:31+00:00	I also accept that some schools are finding it challenging to find teachers in certain subjects. The reasons for this are complex. I have taken some steps already (e.g. expanding the no of places on the Home Ec prog in St. Angela's) &amp; will announce further measures shortly
956187206846214145	2018-01-24 15:29:29+00:00	We are very fortunate to have fantastic teachers in Ireland. I'm delighted that more teachers are now staying in Ireland upon graduating than in previous years (73% of undergrads compared to 59% in 2013)
956187977654439936	2018-01-24 15:32:33+00:00	Teaching is a very attractive, highly respected career option. We recently announced 3,000 promotional opportunities in schools. These new opportunities will mean that 1 in 3 teachers will now be in leadership positions in our schools
956188332068950016	2018-01-24 15:33:58+00:00	The numbers graduating from teacher training courses has remained steady over the past few years - this year, nearly 3,500 teachers will graduate from teacher training courses in 2018
956189157851848704	2018-01-24 15:37:15+00:00	I was also pleased to negotiate a 15-22% pay increase for new teachers. A teacher graduating this year will start on a salary of nearly €36,000. By October 2020, a graduate will start on over €37,600
956474232476721153	2018-01-25 10:30:02+00:00	Today with @JohnHalligan I am announcing another call for new Springboard+ courses
956474542062489605	2018-01-25 10:31:15+00:00	Springboard+ offers fantastic opportunites for people to upskill or reskill throughout their careers, with courses paid either in full or 90% by the government. 47,000 free higher ed places have been provided to date
956474958716264448	2018-01-25 10:32:55+00:00	This year for the first time, all Springboard+ courses will be open to everyone irrespective of their employment status.
956475116304642048	2018-01-25 10:33:32+00:00	Level 6 courses will continue to be free to all people in receipt of certain allowances, including Jobseekers Benefit
956475372593393664	2018-01-25 10:34:33+00:00	This change reflects this government's commitment to life long learning and supporting people to continue their education throughout their career
956475518949392385	2018-01-25 10:35:08+00:00	All Higher Education providers can submit their proposals for Springboard+ courses here https://t.co/uHZ2Ku2hJq
956613976837812225	2018-01-25 19:45:19+00:00	People with jobs will now be eligible for free third level courses https://t.co/8MdtMXjy6Q
956795370117521408	2018-01-26 07:46:07+00:00	I'll be on @morningireland just after 8 speaking ahead of my speech at @IPPN_Education conference
956807010070167552	2018-01-26 08:32:22+00:00	Since 2012/2013, there are 8,900 more teachers working in our schools. No other part of the public service has seen this sort of employment growth in recent years.
956807314908041216	2018-01-26 08:33:35+00:00	I am today suspending the restrictions regarding substitution limits for those on a career break.  This is a temporary measure which we will keep under review to help schools finding it difficult to find substitutes.
956807836243234817	2018-01-26 08:35:39+00:00	My Department will also issue a note to schools today emphasising that a career break should not be granted unless the school is in a position to fill the temporary vacancy that would be created.
956807979600359424	2018-01-26 08:36:13+00:00	Purpose of the career break is not to facilitate someone taking another fulltime job, while retaining the right to return to their former teaching job at any point for up to 5 years.
956808143643840514	2018-01-26 08:36:52+00:00	Career break is meant to facilitate personal development, voluntary service overseas, childcare or self-employment.
956808477271306240	2018-01-26 08:38:12+00:00	Since the foundation of the state my Department has managed teacher supply at primary level. We have controlled the number of courses and the number of places in publicly funded HEIs.
956808519398944768	2018-01-26 08:38:22+00:00	This has not generally been the case at second level where higher education institutions have had autonomy to decide on the enrolment of students seeking to become second level teachers.
956808634746499073	2018-01-26 08:38:49+00:00	This is not a sustainable approach in the context of our ambitions in STEM, in foreign languages and in digital, and in the context of my overall ambition to have the best education and training service in Europe.
956810647056023552	2018-01-26 08:46:49+00:00	We are considering how to introduce subject quotas, targeted at areas of shortage, for those undertaking the second level PME
956811204042870784	2018-01-26 08:49:02+00:00	The undergraduate route to becoming a second level teacher is a very good option for students as it is shorter and less expensive. 5,300 people applied for this adoption last year. I want to double the number of places available.
956811318232797184	2018-01-26 08:49:29+00:00	The increase in the number of places available on these undergraduate teacher training courses needs to start immediately in critical subject areas.
956811701801889792	2018-01-26 08:51:01+00:00	I will shortly be announcing the establishment of a Teacher Supply Steering Group to consider teacher supply issues at primary and post primary.
956817591330361344	2018-01-26 09:14:25+00:00	I am keen that in approaching this issue that we can work with all stakeholders in the best interests of schools and learners.
956818384058048512	2018-01-26 09:17:34+00:00	You can read my full announcement regarding teacher supply issues here  https://t.co/uzpJfb0JAC

960500109518753799	2018-02-05 13:07:25+00:00	Schools will receive grants of up to €33,000 to purchase key enabling technology including tablets, cloud technology and projectors. We must ensure our young people have access to the technologies needed to encourage critical, creative thinking and problem solving skills
960503847830589440	2018-02-05 13:22:17+00:00	All schools have a Digital Learning Plan, outlining the integration of new technologies with the teaching and learning environment of the school.

994106602163703808	2018-05-09 06:47:38+00:00	Will be on @BreakfastNT shortly to discuss our changes to make it easier for a child to access their local school https://t.co/sv4aoaQoTF
994107902813143040	2018-05-09 06:52:48+00:00	Today I am announcing 3 changes which will have a major impact on how a child accesses their local school
994108189586096128	2018-05-09 06:53:56+00:00	These 3 changes are amendments to the Education (Admissions to School) Bill 2016, which were approved by cabinet yesterday
994108433644351488	2018-05-09 06:54:54+00:00	The first of of these amendments will remove the role of religion in school admissions for virtually all primary schools
994108928995811328	2018-05-09 06:56:52+00:00	As I have said before, I believe that it is unfair that a local child of no religion is passed over in favour of a child of religion, living some distance away for access to their local school
994109142460780544	2018-05-09 06:57:43+00:00	Parents should not feel pressured to baptise their child to get access to their local school
994110108404801536	2018-05-09 07:01:34+00:00	While 90% of our primary schools are of a Catholic ethos, recent figures show that over 20% (and growing) of our parent-age population is non-religious. In addition recent marriage statistics for 2017 show that only approximately 51% of marriages occurred in a Catholic ceremony
994110480917594112	2018-05-09 07:03:02+00:00	The government has approved an amendment that will remove religion as a criterion which can be used in school admissions in over 95% of our primary schools
994110725416194048	2018-05-09 07:04:01+00:00	Now on @morningireland to discuss the same. This is about balance and fairness. I don’t think it’s fair that parents feel pressure to baptise their child to get into their local school when they would not otherwise do so https://t.co/JuG3JBkcuY
994110761621426176	2018-05-09 07:04:09+00:00	Under the proposed new law, there will be a protection to ensure that a child of minority faith can still access a school of their faith
994111062613078016	2018-05-09 07:05:21+00:00	The changes balance the rights of three different groups; minority religion families, catholic families, and non-denominational families
994111349893591040	2018-05-09 07:06:30+00:00	Minority religion families, because of their small size within the overall population, could find it difficult to access schools of their own religious ethos
994112008260898818	2018-05-09 07:09:07+00:00	The exception for minority faith children, is because only 1 out of every 20 of our primary schools are of minority ethos and they need to ensure that children of minority faith can access an education through their ethos, if that is their choice
994112340172922881	2018-05-09 07:10:26+00:00	These changes will only impact oversubscribed primary schools (approx 20%), which are predominately locates in large urban areas.
994112541155561472	2018-05-09 07:11:14+00:00	Schools that are not oversubscribed must continue to accept all applicants, regardless of religion
994112760178003968	2018-05-09 07:12:06+00:00	The second amendment is to provide for Irish medium schools to give priority to Irish speaking children
994114119170252800	2018-05-09 07:17:30+00:00	This amendment will allow Irish medium schools (where it is their policy to do so) to give priority in admission to students who have a reasonable age appropriate level of oral fluency in the Irish language, taking account of any special educational needs a child might have
994114494891790336	2018-05-09 07:18:59+00:00	The last amendment, will give the Minister of Education the power to require a school to open a special class for children with special educational needs, when the NCSE deems it necessary to do so
995955860462559232	2018-05-14 09:15:55+00:00	Speaking to @PatKennyNT about our new speech and language programme in schools. 150 schools and pre-schools to participate. I want to give every child a chance to fulfil their potential.
995956182383845376	2018-05-14 09:17:12+00:00	Identifying a speech and language issue in a child, and dealing with that issue, can have a dramatic impact on that child's life prospects

1001028030247120896	2018-05-28 09:10:55+00:00	On @PatKennyNT now to discuss our new process for transferring existing schools to multi or non denominational patronage. Parents of pre school children are being surveyed in 16 areas across the country, asking if they would like to see more choice in their area
1001553548436484096	2018-05-29 19:59:08+00:00	Tonight I am bringing the School Admissions Bill through the Dàil. It will make it easier for parents to access their local schools and to enroll their children in a school that meets their needs.
1001554776532897794	2018-05-29 20:04:01+00:00	It is not fair that parents, who might otherwise not do so, should feel pressure to baptize their children in order to gain admission to their local school. That is why I am proposing to remove the role that religion plays in school admissions in virtually all primary schools
1001951738893688832	2018-05-30 22:21:24+00:00	The Dàil has tonight passed the School Admissions Bill, including my amendment to remove the role that religion plays in school admissions in virtually all primary schools. The legislation will have a historic impact on how children access their local school.
1002075377475387392	2018-05-31 06:32:42+00:00	The School Admissions Bill will also ban waiting lists, to ensure that parents who move to a new area, or parents who rent, are not disadvantaged
1002076188066623488	2018-05-31 06:35:55+00:00	The Bill now provides for a power to compel a school to open a special class. Thanks to @ThomasByrneTD for his work in this area.
1002076650744569856	2018-05-31 06:37:45+00:00	The School Admissions Bill will also ban fees relating to admissions in non-fee charging schools. Where a school is not oversubscribed (approximately 80% of schools) it must admit all students applying under this bill.
1002077394101067776	2018-05-31 06:40:43+00:00	The School Admissions Bill will also provide for a situation where a child (with special educational needs or otherwise) cannot find a school place, and allow the National Council for Special Education or Tusla to designate a school place for the child
1002483795671552001	2018-06-01 09:35:36+00:00	Delighted to be in Kildare to open the new €4m building for Gaelscoil Mhic Aodha with @martinheydonfg.

1060168888162414592	2018-11-07 13:55:34+00:00	Price matters when it comes to choices. We must discourage new private or public investments being made now which lock us in to high carbon patterns of living.
1060168920596955139	2018-11-07 13:55:42+00:00	Increasing Carbon taxes will have a strong role to play and I believe that we need to set a trajectory for increasing carbon taxes between now and 2030. It is important that people have this certainty.

1065251225845813248	2018-11-21 14:30:58+00:00	I said on my appointment that putting in place a trajectory for carbon taxation to 2030 would be important if we are to respond to climate change. Suggestion by @EamonRyan that each party should sign up to a 2030 trajectory is a positive one and I welcome the Taoiseach's support
1065594811581964288	2018-11-22 13:16:15+00:00	The cost of not becoming a leader on climate is not just environmental, it is financial. Missing our 2020 co2 targets will cost Ireland €6-13m. Missing our renewables targets by 4% could cost €90m or more. Development of a Climate Action Plan vital  https://t.co/psClWmkgQc

1102462594458284033	2019-03-04 06:55:39+00:00	Today I am announcing that I will introduce a new Online Safety Act to improve online safety and protect our children online. I will be on @MorningIreland @BreakfastNT shortly
1102520990762962944	2019-03-04 10:47:42+00:00	New technology is transforming how we work, live and learn. This provides huge opportunities for us all, but it also presents new risks which we have to respond to
1102520992113586176	2019-03-04 10:47:43+00:00	I believe that the situation at present where online and social media companies are not subject to any oversight or regulation by the state is no longer sustainable
1102520996014231552	2019-03-04 10:47:43+00:00	The Online Safety Act will place new requirements on operators, such as the requirement to operate an Online Safety Code, which would have a number of minimum requirements, such the prohibition of cyber bullying for example
1102520993380208640	2019-03-04 10:47:43+00:00	The era of self regulation in this area is over and a new Online Safety Act is necessary
1102520994596556801	2019-03-04 10:47:43+00:00	This new legislation will protect our children online and will be overseen by a regulator, an Online Safety Commissioner
1102520997478043648	2019-03-04 10:47:44+00:00	An Online Safety Commissioner will be given a number of powers, such as certifying that the Online Safety Codes put in place by operators are fit for purpose

The Climate Action Plan commits to eliminating non-recyclable plastic and impose higher fees on the production of materials which are difficult to recycle #ClimatePlan2019
1141718860699226112	2019-06-20 14:46:03+00:00	We will also implement measures to ban single-use plastic plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks and cotton buds #ClimatePlan2019
1142135908000501766	2019-06-21 18:23:14+00:00	Arriving in @UCC for the first town hall on my Climate Action Plan. https://t.co/0BUU1phBb8
1142137280930467840	2019-06-21 18:28:42+00:00	This all of government plan will not be successful without listening and hearing the ideas and opportunities that can be achieved by everyone such as families and community groups at a local level
1142138577494708225	2019-06-21 18:33:51+00:00	This ambitious plan sets out the roadmap Ireland will take to meet our 2030 carbon emissions targets and create a net zero carbon society by 2050 @simoncoveney https://t.co/dbJbLDT46A
1142140320827793410	2019-06-21 18:40:47+00:00	This plan is about so much more that reaching emissions targets, my Climate Action Plan will create opportunities that will raise people’s living standards such as retrofitting 500,000 homes, installing 600,000 heat pumps in homes &amp; increasing the number of EVs on our roads to 1m
1142797072506245120	2019-06-23 14:10:28+00:00	I brought forward proposals for a new Online Safety Law in March. This new law would place clear expectations on social media firms to keep children safe online and would be overseen by a new Online Safety Commissioner
1142797757910061056	2019-06-23 14:13:12+00:00	I held a short six week consultation on the proposals which ended mid-April. All submissions to this consultation will be published next week. The issues raised by those who made submissions will be considered in the context of drafting heads of bill to bring to government.
1144183597647257600	2019-06-27 10:00:02+00:00	Will be on @TodaySOR shortly to discuss my proposals to keep children safe online https://t.co/tMLJu21WYq
1144253415322804225	2019-06-27 14:37:28+00:00	I will be in the Dáil shortly for statements on the Climate Action Plan. Our plan sets out the radical reforms needed to cut our reliance on fossil fuels, making our homes more sustainable, our farms more efficient and our businesses more competitive #climateplan2019
1144343554384437249	2019-06-27 20:35:38+00:00	Will be @RTE_PrimeTime shortly to discuss the #ClimateActionPlan2019
1144538172904394753	2019-06-28 09:28:59+00:00	In Manchester at the British Irish Council. Meeting my energy minister counterparts. Good opportunity to discuss issues of mutual concern.
1145670151976693760	2019-07-01 12:27:04+00:00	Great to see this announcement being made. €3 billion investment in renewables will help us meet our big renewable electricity target in the Climate Action Plan and create 200 new jobs https://t.co/faCpGiatEu
1147058538130395136	2019-07-05 08:24:01+00:00	In Thurles Co Tipperary for my 2nd Climate Action Town Hall https://t.co/g8WPzzk4VI
1147066738124701696	2019-07-05 08:56:36+00:00	My #ClimateActionPlan2019 will deliver warmer homes, better-connected communities, smart farming and a more sustainable economy
1147109988671852549	2019-07-05 11:48:28+00:00	In Littleton with @BordnaMona to open their new recycling facility in their former briquette factory. The new plastic recycling Centre will employ 40 people https://t.co/wJBHDuQmQW
1148535373628346371	2019-07-09 10:12:26+00:00	This underlines the importance of implementing the actions contained in the Climate Action Plan. A new cycling project office and a park and ride office with new 5 year strategies. 180,000 EVs on our roads by 2025. Low emission zones. No new fossil fuel car sold post 2030. https://t.co/YbyvEuBss3
1148536024022290432	2019-07-09 10:15:01+00:00	Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is an air pollutant associated with urban areas, strongly linked with traffic emissions. Diesel vehicles have historically far higher nitrogen dioxide emissions than other combustion engines, especially for older vehicles.
1148919286548828160	2019-07-10 11:37:58+00:00	@Lynnie_Nello @CAugustenborg Hi Lynn, thanks for your message. We have set a target to reach 70% renewable electricity by 2030. We will do this through the development of an offshore wind sector, onshore wind and solar power. We will also be removing coal and peat from our electricity generation system.
1149593318658940930	2019-07-12 08:16:20+00:00	In Oranmore Co Galway with @1Hildegarde for my third Town Hall to discuss my all of government Climate Action Plan https://t.co/r8dA1jHZdL
1149653100413587456	2019-07-12 12:13:53+00:00	I have rejected recent criticism from the oil industry in relation to the €500 million Climate Action fund, which the government has set up as part of our plan to deliver Climate Action in Ireland. https://t.co/sJ9yBbSPci
1151092846189056001	2019-07-16 11:34:55+00:00	The Climate Action Delivery Board, chaired by the government Secretary General and the Secretary General of @Dept_CCAE, will be key to ensuring successful implementation of the Climate Action Plan. Based on similar model used to deliver Action Plan for Jobs https://t.co/JYO4Gw3OvF
1151786071895760896	2019-07-18 09:29:33+00:00	Delivering high speed broadband to 1.1m people will unlock the potential of remote working in rural Ireland. Many companies now offer the possibility to remote work but these opportunities are currently closed to much of rural Ireland. https://t.co/Kah55FpfrW
1151797496563294208	2019-07-18 10:14:57+00:00	In @CavanDigitalHub with @HHumphreysFG &amp; Sen Joe O’Reilly to launch the remote working consultation. The way to ensure rural Ireland is not left behind is to invest in the technologies of the future. Remote working will create huge opportunities for the people of rural Ireland https://t.co/8Y7ARIm5v5
1151798232265232386	2019-07-18 10:17:52+00:00	With high speed broadband, a person can do the same job remotely in Ballybay as they can sitting in an office in Ballsbridge https://t.co/vqFMpkWjzI
1151922362666889216	2019-07-18 18:31:07+00:00	In Grange Woodbine Community Centre Raheny for the 4th of my Climate Action Town Halls. We need to dramatically change our reliance on fossil fuels and my Climate Action Plan sets over 180 actions on how this change can be achieved https://t.co/tC8WS0uR3m
1153970823520247808	2019-07-24 10:10:58+00:00	Will be speaking at #MacGill2019 shortly. Extract from my speech can be found here-   https://t.co/VOy8fgOl7g https://t.co/OyaEfuEnuG
1153975894383439872	2019-07-24 10:31:07+00:00	Climate disruption is the biggest challenge facing this generation.  Previously Ireland set a target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. However current forecasts suggest that only a 1% reduction will be delivered. #MacGill2019
1153976223120445446	2019-07-24 10:32:26+00:00	Ireland has not been lacking in ambition, but in delivery.  There has been no coherent strategy that would in fact deliver on commitments made.  We cannot countenance another such failure. That is why the government’s Climate Action Plan has taken a completely different approach
1153976329844482048	2019-07-24 10:32:51+00:00	Now, for the first time ever, we know the least cost, least burden roadmap of actions which will ensure we reach our 2030 climate commitments and put us on a trajectory to reach net zero emissions by 2050 #MacGill2019
1153976435645800448	2019-07-24 10:33:16+00:00	An immediate start must be made because the longer we put off action, the harder it will be and the more irreversible damages will have been done #MacGill2019
1153976571771990016	2019-07-24 10:33:49+00:00	The Plan envisages radical change. In 2030, we will have 5 times the amount of renewables on our grid that we have today (requiring capacity to peak at 95% electricity generation from renewable sources). 33% of the cars on our road will be fully electric or hybrids (1/2)
1153976703426994177	2019-07-24 10:34:20+00:00	No new car purchased from that year on, will be fuelled by fossils, compared to 98% that are purchased today. All the plastic in your local supermarket will be fully recyclable. Food waste will be halved. 30% of our homes will be fuelled by renewable heat vs 2% today #MacGill2019
1153976790517538816	2019-07-24 10:34:41+00:00	As we saw with the Action Plan for Jobs, fundamental reform can only be driven by sustained, consistent action. A strong governance framework and oversight to ensure implementation set this Plan apart #MacGill2019
1153976881831710720	2019-07-24 10:35:03+00:00	Symbolic gestures will do nothing to solve the climate crisis. There are no silver bullets. Responding to this crisis requires action across the board, led by the government, with structures in place to ensure accountability #MacGill2019
1153977070051123200	2019-07-24 10:35:48+00:00	This Plan recognizes the balanced nature of the social contract which we need to strike with the Irish public #MacGill2019
1153977213127188480	2019-07-24 10:36:22+00:00	It is built on three principles: pursuing the policies which offer the least burden &amp; greatest opportunity; recognizing need to support those most exposed &amp; least equipped to meet the challenge and ensuring every section of society make their fair contribution, while govt leads
1153977333130452992	2019-07-24 10:36:50+00:00	To sustain this contract, we will engage in continuous monitoring and open feedback to ensure the policies we have in place are the best ones for our country #MacGill2019
1153977446145974279	2019-07-24 10:37:17+00:00	This challenge is also a test of the creative capacity for international cooperation. The European Union must seek to lead the change that is required and our capacity for solidarity will no doubt be crucial in this endeavour #MacGill2019
1153977609354657792	2019-07-24 10:37:56+00:00	A new toolbox will be required. One that leverages aid, trade, research and compacts in the pursuit of a radical shift towards decarbonization #MacGill2019
1153977704573800448	2019-07-24 10:38:19+00:00	Ultimately, this is not about our ranking in some European Union or UN league table about ourselves and our children. It is about the resilience of our homes, our farms, our enterprises and our planet for our children and the generation which come after #MacGill2019
1153977778540359681	2019-07-24 10:38:36+00:00	We will be living more connected, healthier lives. Our air will be cleaner. Our homes will be warmer.  We will look back at the disposable culture we have now with disbelief. We will have enterprises able to compete and create jobs in a very changed world #MacGill2019
1153977872920567808	2019-07-24 10:38:59+00:00	The time for rhetoric is over. Sustained, consistent action across every sector, driven from the highest level of government is the only way we will meet this challenge. It will define us as a generation #MacGill2019
1154036545742966784	2019-07-24 14:32:08+00:00	In relation to the publication of the Climate Change Advisory Council’s report, I want to acknowledge the work of the Council in producing this important review
1154036547534016512	2019-07-24 14:32:08+00:00	The advice of the Council has had a substantial influence on the development of the recently published Climate Action Plan.
1154036549132013569	2019-07-24 14:32:08+00:00	While I recognise that the Council has not yet had the opportunity to evaluate the Plan in full, I am pleased with the Council’s supportive comments following its publication &amp; look forward to their full review &amp; feedback, which will be important for future iterations of the Plan
1154036551598239745	2019-07-24 14:32:09+00:00	The intention for the Climate Action Plan is that it is a living, evolving plan that adapts in response to feedback and experience.
1154036553364066304	2019-07-24 14:32:09+00:00	While the focus of the recently published Plan has been on the reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions, the Advisory Council’s report is a timely reminder that we must also ensure that appropriate consideration is given to embedding robust adaptation measures across the system.
1154036554983063553	2019-07-24 14:32:10+00:00	This feedback will be taken into account as we develop our 2020 Plan.
1156899927592775680	2019-08-01 12:10:11+00:00	Looking forward to this. Young people have led the way with their passion. We must act now to secure a more sustainable future for the generations which come after us https://t.co/CR2Yx5t700
1157208344404381696	2019-08-02 08:35:43+00:00	However, we must recognise that the landscape in which broadcasters operate is undergoing a transformation and that this gives rise to new challenges.
1157208342567301120	2019-08-02 08:35:43+00:00	Public service broadcasting is more important now than ever. Independent, objective reporting of domestic and international affairs is crucial.
1157208347126509569	2019-08-02 08:35:44+00:00	It will allow for the creation of a new funding scheme that would allow the granting of bursaries to journalists in local or community radio stations. We must support our local community radio stations and independent broadcasters.
1157208345704632322	2019-08-02 08:35:44+00:00	Today, I am publishing the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019. This Bill will enable the broadcasting levy to be reduced for all broadcasters and for some community broadcasters to be exempted entirely.
1157208352876900353	2019-08-02 08:35:45+00:00	Most people pay their T.V. licence fee. However, we still see approximately 12% evasion which we need to address. By tendering for a contract of 5 years, this will allow the awarded body the chance to invest in a robust collection service
1157208351572467712	2019-08-02 08:35:45+00:00	The collection of the T.V. licence fee will be put out to public tender later this year.
1157208354160283648	2019-08-02 08:35:46+00:00	It is also clear that due to the nature of technological change and the movement towards digital devices, the design of the T.V. licence fee will have to change.
1157208356844711936	2019-08-02 08:35:46+00:00	The current provision of free TV licences to those in receipt of the Household Benefits Package will continue. The option of purchasing TV licences at post offices will remain regardless of who the successful awardee of the contract is.
1157208355494084608	2019-08-02 08:35:46+00:00	This is a fundamental reform that will take time to develop, but it will future proof the funding model, taking account of changes in technology and in how content is now consumed.
1163420824273117184	2019-08-19 12:01:54+00:00	This morning I met with the CEO of @SEAI_ie, Jim Gannon, to discuss the next steps for the deep retrofit pilot scheme. I asked the SEAI to process all applications for the deep retrofit pilot scheme which were received before the July deadline.
1163421158500392960	2019-08-19 12:03:14+00:00	Anyone who has submitted an application by the closing date can be assured that their application will be assessed and honoured in line with the existing terms and conditions of the scheme. No work should commence on site until you receive approval to proceed.
1163421406589325312	2019-08-19 12:04:13+00:00	Given the huge level of interest in this scheme, I believe that putting applications received on hold while a new review is carried out is not providing enough certainty given the huge amount of work &amp; energy that home owners &amp; contractors have done to get applications in
1163421783778889730	2019-08-19 12:05:43+00:00	I will be discussing this on @RTENewsAtOne shortly
1163422516012113921	2019-08-19 12:08:37+00:00	The retrofitting of 500,000 homes, to make them warmer and more energy efficient, is a key action under the Climate Action Plan. These upgrades will help deliver on our climate commitments, which will result in warmer homes &amp; will save homeowners money via cheaper energy bills
1163422685369688064	2019-08-19 12:09:18+00:00	The new model will group home retrofits in the same area together to reduce costs, develop easy pay back mechanisms like through your electricity bill, and get access to new smart finance and loan options.
1163422721612668928	2019-08-19 12:09:26+00:00	This new model of retrofitting will be vital to achieve the target set out in the Climate Action Plan to deliver 500,000 homes.
1163422848960159744	2019-08-19 12:09:57+00:00	The Task Force will be chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.
1163423123166900224	2019-08-19 12:11:02+00:00	I can assure contractors and home owners that the October deadline to complete retrofitting works will not apply, with completion dates likely to move into 2020 for new grants offered.
1163553137799643141	2019-08-19 20:47:40+00:00	Should be a great event 🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏻‍♀️ https://t.co/8IXK6xidxH
1165928503977660416	2019-08-26 10:06:31+00:00	I announced today a new scheme to support the roll out of 1,000 electric vehicle charging points by local authorities. One of a number of measures we are taking to support electric vehicle roll out. Builds on Climate Action Fund investment announced earlier this year
1165928804931506176	2019-08-26 10:07:43+00:00	We will also introduce new regulations to require non-domestic buildings with over 20 car parking spaces to install charging points
1165929193160527872	2019-08-26 10:09:16+00:00	Increasing the number of on-street charge points will remove a key barrier to the uptake of electric vehicles. In many cases, on-street charge points may be integrated with street lighting in a single lamppost.
1166702809502367744	2019-08-28 13:23:20+00:00	On the Sheehan family farm in Cuffesgrange Co. Kilkenny to discuss the many benefits Smart Farming can provide to all farmers.

1166991494676393984	2019-08-29 08:30:28+00:00	Industry has a vital role to play in tackling climate disruption
1166992140678905857	2019-08-29 08:33:02+00:00	This is an opportunity to discuss how we can undertake the transition and exploit the new opportunities opened up by our determined aim to lower greenhouse gas emissions and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050
1166993257689243648	2019-08-29 08:37:28+00:00	When we succeed Ireland will be a better place with cleaner air, warmer homes, more resilient enterprises, more secure incomes and jobs and a sustainable relationship with the world around us, that we can proudly pass on to the next generation.
1168788903496753152	2019-09-03 07:32:44+00:00	Delighted to visit St Michael’s House in Coolock which provides important services for people with disabilities. In total we will provide €25m to 57 successful applicants to do energy upgrades - equivalent to taking 11,000 petrol / diesel cars off the road! https://t.co/1eVbvYUM1k
1169209495605657600	2019-09-04 11:24:01+00:00	Great to be in Offaly this morning turning the sod on 2 new €150m battery storage facilities.

1173526931427471360	2019-09-16 09:19:58+00:00	Banning a range of single-use plastics, new fees on non-recyclable plastics, like on food packaging in supermarkets, and halving food waste will be vital to ensuring the Climate Action Plan succeeds. Hosting an important summit today about implementing the change https://t.co/Is3rdPPtUT

1354378480339865601	2021-01-27 10:39:27+00:00	SF is again misusing statistics to bolster its threadbare Housing Policy. @EOBroin in the @IrishTimes seeks to pretend that the bricks &amp; mortar cost represents the entire cost for a private builder.  https://t.co/vO9bvGcNWX
1354378481837207553	2021-01-27 10:39:27+00:00	The same report which he quoted states that bricks &amp; mortar represent only 47% of costs.   This fact completely demolishes the headline which the paper runs of @DubCityCouncil paying €100,000 too much for social housing.
