1102520996014231552	2019-03-04 10:47:43+00:00	The Online Safety Act will place new requirements on operators, such as the requirement to operate an Online Safety Code, which would have a number of minimum requirements, such the prohibition of cyber bullying for example
1102520994596556801	2019-03-04 10:47:43+00:00	This new legislation will protect our children online and will be overseen by a regulator, an Online Safety Commissioner
1102520993380208640	2019-03-04 10:47:43+00:00	The era of self regulation in this area is over and a new Online Safety Act is necessary
1102520992113586176	2019-03-04 10:47:43+00:00	I believe that the situation at present where online and social media companies are not subject to any oversight or regulation by the state is no longer sustainable
