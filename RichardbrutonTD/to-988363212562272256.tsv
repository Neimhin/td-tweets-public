995956182383845376	2018-05-14 09:17:12+00:00	Identifying a speech and language issue in a child, and dealing with that issue, can have a dramatic impact on that child's life prospects
995955860462559232	2018-05-14 09:15:55+00:00	Speaking to @PatKennyNT about our new speech and language programme in schools. 150 schools and pre-schools to participate. I want to give every child a chance to fulfil their potential.
994114494891790336	2018-05-09 07:18:59+00:00	The last amendment, will give the Minister of Education the power to require a school to open a special class for children with special educational needs, when the NCSE deems it necessary to do so
994114119170252800	2018-05-09 07:17:30+00:00	This amendment will allow Irish medium schools (where it is their policy to do so) to give priority in admission to students who have a reasonable age appropriate level of oral fluency in the Irish language, taking account of any special educational needs a child might have
994112760178003968	2018-05-09 07:12:06+00:00	The second amendment is to provide for Irish medium schools to give priority to Irish speaking children
994112541155561472	2018-05-09 07:11:14+00:00	Schools that are not oversubscribed must continue to accept all applicants, regardless of religion
994112340172922881	2018-05-09 07:10:26+00:00	These changes will only impact oversubscribed primary schools (approx 20%), which are predominately locates in large urban areas.
994112008260898818	2018-05-09 07:09:07+00:00	The exception for minority faith children, is because only 1 out of every 20 of our primary schools are of minority ethos and they need to ensure that children of minority faith can access an education through their ethos, if that is their choice
994111349893591040	2018-05-09 07:06:30+00:00	Minority religion families, because of their small size within the overall population, could find it difficult to access schools of their own religious ethos
994111062613078016	2018-05-09 07:05:21+00:00	The changes balance the rights of three different groups; minority religion families, catholic families, and non-denominational families
994110761621426176	2018-05-09 07:04:09+00:00	Under the proposed new law, there will be a protection to ensure that a child of minority faith can still access a school of their faith
994110725416194048	2018-05-09 07:04:01+00:00	Now on @morningireland to discuss the same. This is about balance and fairness. I don’t think it’s fair that parents feel pressure to baptise their child to get into their local school when they would not otherwise do so https://t.co/JuG3JBkcuY
994110480917594112	2018-05-09 07:03:02+00:00	The government has approved an amendment that will remove religion as a criterion which can be used in school admissions in over 95% of our primary schools
994110108404801536	2018-05-09 07:01:34+00:00	While 90% of our primary schools are of a Catholic ethos, recent figures show that over 20% (and growing) of our parent-age population is non-religious. In addition recent marriage statistics for 2017 show that only approximately 51% of marriages occurred in a Catholic ceremony
994109142460780544	2018-05-09 06:57:43+00:00	Parents should not feel pressured to baptise their child to get access to their local school
994108928995811328	2018-05-09 06:56:52+00:00	As I have said before, I believe that it is unfair that a local child of no religion is passed over in favour of a child of religion, living some distance away for access to their local school
994108433644351488	2018-05-09 06:54:54+00:00	The first of of these amendments will remove the role of religion in school admissions for virtually all primary schools
994108189586096128	2018-05-09 06:53:56+00:00	These 3 changes are amendments to the Education (Admissions to School) Bill 2016, which were approved by cabinet yesterday
994107902813143040	2018-05-09 06:52:48+00:00	Today I am announcing 3 changes which will have a major impact on how a child accesses their local school
994106602163703808	2018-05-09 06:47:38+00:00	Will be on @BreakfastNT shortly to discuss our changes to make it easier for a child to access their local school https://t.co/sv4aoaQoTF

989815561516396545	2018-04-27 10:36:34+00:00	The transitions our students take in our education system is a very big step for each child and I am conscious that we make these experiences a positive experience for all children
