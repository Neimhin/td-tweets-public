1194349002499788800	2019-11-12 20:19:26+00:00	@farrellybrian 1/3 Hi Brian, thanks very much for taking the time to reply to my letter.  We do need more housing desperately - but what I'm objecting to is Gov's continued over-reliance on the private market and acceding to developer-led policy demands like the SHD process is.
1194349075233042433	2019-11-12 20:19:44+00:00	@farrellybrian 2/3 The SHD process has resulted in planning permissions – but proportionately very little actual housing construction: https://t.co/3ISMCJDHPF
1194349176701771776	2019-11-12 20:20:08+00:00	@farrellybrian We need public housing on public land, and Gov needs to require developers to provide a much more diverse mix of housing than developer-led preference of primarily high-end buy-to-lets.
1194558727581569025	2019-11-13 10:12:49+00:00	@ThomasCurran11 @greenparty_ie @AlanHurleyArt @FinianMcGrathTD @savecuisle Hi Thomas, I very much support the @savecuisle campaign and hope to be at the protest today with my colleague @Julie_ODonoghue.

1194611667595939840	2019-11-13 13:43:11+00:00	People with disabilities and their families deserve to be consulted on decisions that will have such an effect on their ability to access respite and holiday breaks - well done to @savecuisle and @Julie_ODonoghue for rallying around a service that has done great work for 20 years https://t.co/cOy4REHOWB
