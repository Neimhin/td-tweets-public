I requested a further update from the Minister on the situation in University of Limerick &amp; questioned if further SUSI grants or financial supports will be made available to students impacted by Covid-19 https://t.co/v4MGbRfxaA
1255181653636456450	2020-04-28 17:06:41+00:00	Last week in the D√°il, I asked the Minister for Education for further clarity on the postponement of the Leaving Cert, the possibility of cancelling exams and implementing a predicted grades system, and what extra mental health supports will be made available to LC students https://t.co/FqMgwsqFyG

1253654373902802945	2020-04-24 11:57:49+00:00	@criodanomurchu @SpunOut @McHughJoeTD My issue was with the ongoing pattern of information distribution over the last number of weeks, that the Min hasn't been as clear, consistent and comprehensive as he could have been and that students deserve better. 3/3
1253654031077163008	2020-04-24 11:56:27+00:00	@criodanomurchu @SpunOut @McHughJoeTD Yesterday in the D√°il I mentioned the lack of clarity and certainty students have been facing going back to his original announcement two weeks ago and before that - students deserve clear, formal, comprehensive information on this issue. 2/
1253653592080371716	2020-04-24 11:54:42+00:00	@criodanomurchu @SpunOut @McHughJoeTD Hi Criod√°n, I 100% agree that the amazing work @SpunOut does is vitally important for students right across the country. Exactly as you say, the postponement of the LC + the arrangements around that are issues for the Min to deal with, and it was him alone I was criticising. 1/

1248957955342512128	2020-04-11 12:55:55+00:00	The Minister for Ed is in a difficult situation but unfortunately the more he tries to clarify arrangements for #LeavingCert2020 the more questions arise. Lack of clarity leads to stress for our students. Issue of digital divide and other inequalities need to be addressed.
1248669346945216513	2020-04-10 17:49:06+00:00	@npmalone Agree. Uncertainty and stress remains for students

We are in the midst of an unprecedented crisis. This policy safeguards student‚Äôs academic futures and ensures they are not adversely affected.
