I spoke on the Week in Politics last Sunday of how public representatives must be cognisant that consequences stem and flow from utterances  or comments made by us and there is no room for language of intolerance or hostility. https://t.co/ZOd99J7gA2

1194925242612879362	2019-11-14 10:29:13+00:00	Today is #WorldPrematurityDay. I was delighted when my motion to give mothers of premature babies additional maternity leave passed in the Dáil - but there’s still so much we need to do; we urgently need to increase space in our maternity hospitals for these babies. https://t.co/PbcTqj9cTj
1194611667595939840	2019-11-13 13:43:11+00:00	People with disabilities and their families deserve to be consulted on decisions that will have such an effect on their ability to access respite and holiday breaks - well done to @savecuisle and @Julie_ODonoghue for rallying around a service that has done great work for 20 years https://t.co/cOy4REHOWB

People with disabilities deserve to have their voices heard rather than have policies forced upon them.
1194349176701771776	2019-11-12 20:20:08+00:00	@farrellybrian We need public housing on public land, and Gov needs to require developers to provide a much more diverse mix of housing than developer-led preference of primarily high-end buy-to-lets.
1194349075233042433	2019-11-12 20:19:44+00:00	@farrellybrian 2/3 The SHD process has resulted in planning permissions – but proportionately very little actual housing construction: https://t.co/3ISMCJDHPF
1194349002499788800	2019-11-12 20:19:26+00:00	@farrellybrian 1/3 Hi Brian, thanks very much for taking the time to reply to my letter.  We do need more housing desperately - but what I'm objecting to is Gov's continued over-reliance on the private market and acceding to developer-led policy demands like the SHD process is.
1192786090299670528	2019-11-08 12:48:59+00:00	.@Costellop and I wrote to Minister Ross yesterday to ask for 4 key urgent actions on cyclist safety - it's long past time for us to protect vulnerable road users. #Allocate4Cycling #iBikeActionWeek #StopKillingCyclists https://t.co/Ei1xeYJMMe
