1439700896670265349	2021-09-19 21:20:16+00:00	The homophobic, bigoted intimidation witnessed at the home of Leo Varadkar today is outrageous   and shameful. The perpetrators must be held to account.

Uachtar√°n na h√âireann has made clear his decision not to attend a commemorative event. His decision is the correct one.
1438406473395195908	2021-09-16 07:36:42+00:00	The arrogance of FG is again loudly  amplified over the airwaves this morning. They got away with yet another episode of crony politics and they are back in business. All courtesy of @fiannafailparty @greenparty_ie and assorted Independents. #morningireland
