1520050740647055362	2022-04-29 14:41:52+00:00	Having the chats in sunny Belfast. Cost of living, investment in health, working in partnership are front and centre. Next Thursday is the day to vote for a First Minister for all. Seize that chance. Use your vote #AE22 #SinnFein https://t.co/bTh4firRqk
1519959032144052226	2022-04-29 08:37:27+00:00	@PhuckleI There is no such insinuation. Rural people and communities care deeply about health and the environment. Just transition means supporting and facilitating change. Govt incompetence and indifference to struggling families in a cost of living crisis is the issue causing disgust
1519319273012932608	2022-04-27 14:15:16+00:00	Champions in the House! Delighted to welcome @KilcooGAC  A club and community with passion and drive 🏆. @ChrisHazzardSF @CathyMasonSF https://t.co/0V3tZJeTR3
1519252833194979328	2022-04-27 09:51:16+00:00	@ThatVeganScot @GrainneFerris This isn't an abstraction. People and families cannot be left in the cold. The ball is in govts court - including the Greens - to mitigate and protect those families.
1519228660586319872	2022-04-27 08:15:13+00:00	@ThatVeganScot @GrainneFerris There is no mitigation or just transition for people/families affected. That is the very point. It's Govt's job to get this right. They are failing. Struggling families are at best an afterthought. This is about poverty/struggling families/cost of living crisis denial.  Not on.

1518944370476699648	2022-04-26 13:25:33+00:00	Another day in the Dail. Taoiseach fails again to answer question put to him. He resorts again to attacking the questioner instead. The proposed ban on turf is wrong &amp; should not proceed. Govt backbenchers can put a stop to it by supporting the Sinn Féin motion this evening.
1518557182052159489	2022-04-25 11:47:00+00:00	Putting money back in people's pockets, giving workers and families a break, investing in health services - these are the first priorities for the incoming Executive. We will work hard, in partnership with others to  plan for our new Ireland #AE22 https://t.co/p134X6FRZe

1514206049800265737	2022-04-13 11:37:09+00:00	The opportunity for our people, our society, our economy is immense. We can achieve energy independence for Ireland, become an exporter of energy and create big wins for our communities. Working together all is possible. This is a time for strong leadership.  #WEIConf22 https://t.co/6HUkzb87OR
1513867072916361219	2022-04-12 13:10:11+00:00	Huge credit to an Garda Síochána @GardaTraffic and US authorities striking a significant blow against the Kinihan Drug gang. There can be no safe haven for this vicious gang who has preyed on our communities for far too long.

1512376910210293765	2022-04-08 10:28:48+00:00	Another fine mess. Will this  government ever learn that public appointments paid for by public money must be fully transparent. The rules must be followed and applied in respect of all positions.
