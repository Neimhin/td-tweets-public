The proposed ban on turf is wrong &amp; should not proceed. Govt backbenchers can put a stop to it by supporting the Sinn F√©in motion this evening.

It's Govt's job to get this right. They are failing. Struggling families are at best an afterthought. This is about poverty/struggling families/cost of living crisis denial.  Not on.

He refuses again to bring forward an emergency budget.  He dismisses experiences of people who are struggling. Says they must wait till October.
