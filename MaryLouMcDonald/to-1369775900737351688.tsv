Yet Government has failed to get basics right on test &amp; trace, yet to be introduced half measures on travel quarantine &amp; a lethargic vaccine rollout. https://t.co/f5lxunrYuV

1371441053165834240	2021-03-15 12:40:01+00:00	The leaking of a confidential GP contract by Leo Varadkar is the worst of stroke politics. He should have been sacked. The criminal investigation now underway underlines the seriousness of this case. Leo Varadkar's position was untenable last November and is untenable today. #

It will push up house prices, saddle working people with more debt. Keeping an entire generation locked out of home ownership.   It is a scam https://t.co/0vGCYtcXsH
