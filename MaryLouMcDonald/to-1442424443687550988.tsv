Hence legislation came from Westminster. No question of us 'doing nothing'. No interest in blame game either. Women need services. Those blocking them must be accountable for that.

We have been absolutely consistent with the legislation mandated by the repeal of the 8th referendum and consistent with the demands of the repeal campaign.

1455178616854175745	2021-11-01 14:23:12+00:00	@BarbaraWhearty @liznangel3 SF policy consistent across Ireland -provision of same services North &amp; South.Unionist minister refuses to commission services. That's the problem. DUP motion on non fatal foetal anomoly (which falls outside law in South)-a distraction tactic.
