1571092160661032960	2022-09-17 11:02:15+00:00	It is incredible that Government will   increase carbon taxes at a time when families, workers and businesses struggle with energy and fuel costs.

FF/FG govt act as  onlookers, commentators, fence sitters, kite flyers for months on end. Govt action is needed. No more dithering or excuses.

1570655217628385281	2022-09-16 06:05:59+00:00	@marksugruek @TonightVMTV Yes. That's why the electricity cut and cap applies universally but forest cash payments are targeted under our proposal
1569798077162168335	2022-09-13 21:20:01+00:00	Claiming that emigration is a 'lifestyle choice' is an insult to young Irish people.  Irish emigrants who desperately want to come back home but can't are denied their 'lifestyle choice' #TonightVMTV

1569686033696198657	2022-09-13 13:54:48+00:00	@gavreilly That's not what was said or meant. They go hand in hand yes but one does not fund the other.
1569674773269024771	2022-09-13 13:10:03+00:00	@gavreilly To be clear: At no stage did I 'claim' that energy cap would be funded by windfall tax.
1569664723116867584	2022-09-13 12:30:07+00:00	Team @sinnfeinireland today  prepare for new Dail term.

1562546474525028352	2022-08-24 21:04:44+00:00	Disastrous govt housing policy will not change simply with the exit of one minister.  We need to see the back of the whole govt.  Only  with a change of govt will we see housing policy designed for workers and families, for the people. FF/FG look after vested interests. Always.

Having broadcast live a FF/FG event I assume that @rte will also broadcast a SF event as we mark and remember other Republican revolutionary leaders this year?

1545317514527342594	2022-07-08 08:03:00+00:00	Today we lodge of motion of no confidence in government. This  government has lost its parliamentary majority, failed to tackle the cost of living and housing crises. This government is out of touch and out of time. We need  a government that puts workers and families first.
1545035223573856257	2022-07-07 13:21:17+00:00	Boris Johnson's interactions with Ireland have been wholly negative - Brexit, attacks on the Good Friday Agreement, threats to break international law, austerity and placating the DUP - all in a self serving attempt to cling to power. He has come unstuck. He will not be missed.
1544417670073925633	2022-07-05 20:27:21+00:00	Sinn F√©in has forced government to move and give something on back to school costs BUT the  government failed to give support to middle income families under real pressure  to pay for books, uniforms, sports gear and and and....  We'll keep the pressure on them to get this right
1544313061695176705	2022-07-05 13:31:40+00:00	The back to school allowance must be extended to middle income families who do not qualify for any state help. For low income families the rate of the allowance must be increased. Action on this is urgent. Govt cannot leave families struggling.
