VAT not addressed at all by Govt despite being pressed  for months

We have a cost of living crisis. We can't afford a dithering government. We are continuing our pressure on these matters today https://t.co/uJRIze1eTd
1501222453627998209	2022-03-08 15:44:58+00:00	Government refuses to act with urgency to cut costs of petrol, diesel and home heating oil (by cutting /abolishing excise duties) . Families, workers, businesses under huge pressure. Some in panic at this stage. Taoiseach and government are dithering.

1497235738949296131	2022-02-25 15:43:12+00:00	It is clear that significantly strenthened sanctions on Russia are needed. The situation has now reached a point where this must include the expulsion of the Russian Amabassador to Ireland. #russianinvasion
1496822109909266434	2022-02-24 12:19:35+00:00	The international community response to Russian aggression &amp; breaches of international law must be strong &amp; united The invasion of Ukraine, the violent attack on its sovereignty, territory &amp; innocent citizens is an act of war Sanctions must be commensurate with Russian aggression
1496616634823417864	2022-02-23 22:43:06+00:00	@oilyslick1 We have consistently called for this. I raised it most recently last week in Taoiseach's questions
1496596937373626369	2022-02-23 21:24:49+00:00	The Government has just voted to increase the cost of home heating fuels through a carbon tax hike in May.  This will only put pressure on already hard-pressed workers and families. Another example of just how out-of-touch this government is. Disgraceful https://t.co/PuFlZGy7B9
1496473126443618308	2022-02-23 13:12:51+00:00	An entire generation locked out of homeownership. Extortionate rents. Sweetheart tax deals for cuckoo funds. No answers. Just deflection. And spin. Pathetic indeed. The Govt and the Taoiseach will be vigorously challenged on this by us. For as long as it takes.
