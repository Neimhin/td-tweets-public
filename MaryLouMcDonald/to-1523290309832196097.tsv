Above all he  spoke out for those who are suffering now. Our first citizen spoke for all of us. Rather than attacking him Govt should listen. Carefully.

1526535281070989312	2022-05-17 12:09:07+00:00	The British government announces its intention to legislate to break the law.  The stuff of a Rogue State. Meanwhile government and progress blocked  in the North of Ireland.

The concerns are real, well founded and must be heard. What was the point in delaying govt sign off if these concerns are to be dismissed in this way?
