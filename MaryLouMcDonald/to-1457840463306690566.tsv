Dublin City Council's refusal of planning permission for a hotel which would have effectively seen it destroyed is hugely welcome. The same reasoning must now mean refusing permission for the  Hammerson plan for Moore Street #Cobblestone

A pillar of any democratic system. People are being very careful. So careful they want access to timely testing. And a govt that is efficient and accountable.

1458077056382775299	2021-11-09 14:20:34+00:00	Govt cozying up to Cuckoo funds as our people face a housing crisis. Taoiseach won't answer questions on this - just bluff and bluster. #FFFGCuckoos
