We have deep problems.   The first step is to accept that.   For men in particular to accept that.

Parents in my experience are anxious to amalgamate schools but process is slow. Dept haven‚Äôt sanctioned a new single gender school since 1998.

1481204680176906241	2022-01-12 10:01:29+00:00	@Flyck66 @dulchiewhelan So in summary: You don‚Äôt know what the issue is really about. You don‚Äôt know what the stance of the various players actually is. And you made a crass assumption as to what my motivation was. And you decided to do all this in a public forum. Oh dear.
1481198048780992512	2022-01-12 09:35:08+00:00	@Flyck66 @dulchiewhelan So he‚Äôll know where the teacher unions stand on this? Seeing as you don‚Äôt?
1481196472016285697	2022-01-12 09:28:52+00:00	@Flyck66 @dulchiewhelan Firstly I‚Äôm in disagreement with the Trade Unions on the issue. If you‚Äôd been following the debate you‚Äôd be aware of this. Secondly the issue is of availability of teachers, not the rate of recovery of students. Thirdly - spend some time talking to 6th year students like I do.

1479818502601125888	2022-01-08 14:13:19+00:00	The reality is that if a principal got a call from the Dept asking how they were getting on, they would most likely faint with shock.  We  don‚Äôt have a proactive &amp; caring Education Dept / Minister.  It seems enough for them to have opened schools.   Simply not good enough.  3/3
1479818501263081477	2022-01-08 14:13:19+00:00	A proactive &amp; caring Education Dept / Minister would have assembled a task force of officials spanning expertise in health, education &amp; housing a year ago.   Such a group would proactively engage with every school to provide advice, funding &amp; resources to meet their needs.  2/3

Minister didn‚Äôt respond to my request for meeting with all opposition education spokespersons when I wrote to her on Nov 16th.  üëä Demand resources for your school üëä Demand support from the Dept &amp; HSE üëä Demand Hybrid Leaving Cert for 2022  3/3

1478433560214355970	2022-01-04 18:30:03+00:00	Govt are hoping school re-opening debate will be row between parents &amp; school staff with unions in the middle.  DON‚ÄôT FALL FOR IT.  ‚úÖ Children need to be at school ‚úÖ Teachers/SNAs need safe workplace  Both statements are true.  Late announcement today exposes Govt failures: 1/3

Important to credit those in government, particularly @greenparty_ie reps, who I know have been working hard to make this happen.  #DECRIM https://t.co/peyv7jOe6z

There has been too much disruption to pretend #LeavingCert2022 can continue as planned.  Minister must announce another hybrid LC immediately, as in 2021.
1477315814386716684	2022-01-01 16:28:32+00:00	@Sinnerdine It is a mess though isn‚Äôt it?
1477313423050526721	2022-01-01 16:19:01+00:00	One of my 2022 missions is to finally let Clontarf village realise its massive potential.  Surely creating a public plaza would benefit everyone much more than current traffic mess?  Imagine this as open public space for dining &amp; markets.  Time to stop being enslaved to the car. https://t.co/hSeKgjNogt
