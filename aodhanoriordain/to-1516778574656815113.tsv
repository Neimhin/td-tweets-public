Opposition &amp; govt TDs propose amendments, often accepted by govt.  Bills are improved. But rows get more  coverage unfortunately. https://t.co/Q8EhdeVRMx

Romanticisation of war &amp; conflict needs to be challenged.   There is no glory in a gravestone, no matter what flag gets you excited. https://t.co/pcjfwMX6Ew

She fronted up for Repeal in 2018 in a divided party and from a constituency where every other TD was silent or in the NO camp.  We all make mistakes but @lichamber stood up when others didn‚Äôt
