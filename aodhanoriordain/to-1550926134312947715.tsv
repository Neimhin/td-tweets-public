1566406248743985152	2022-09-04 12:42:06+00:00	Outrageous that not a single Minister or government representative was available to speak to @thisweekrte to speak to the issue that is keeping families &amp; business owners awake at night - energy bills.

1552687909370839042	2022-07-28 16:10:19+00:00	This is one of FG‚Äôs 2020 election videos talking the talk on climate action.  Other glossy videos have individual Oireachtas members focusing on personal &amp; consumer responsibility.  Remember what they were arguing for this week: climate cowardice. https://t.co/KHzMrvWbrN

A dysfunctional housing system entirely developer-led with completely inadequate oversight.  ‚ÄúBillions in remediation works cannot be levied on builders, report finds ‚Äì The Irish Times‚Äù https://t.co/UAr5Q1dyV6

School principals are worried about money and parents associations become fundraising entities.  Who talks about education when everyone is talking about money? https://t.co/vPCubsfXMl
1551840066397429763	2022-07-26 08:01:18+00:00	Last October we argued for a free book scheme for schoolchildren.  It would cost ‚Ç¨40m.  Govt chose instead to give away ‚Ç¨500m in tax cuts.  @labour have raised cost of living issues at every budget time.  Govt don‚Äôt listen. https://t.co/RugTqMgj4u

Today‚Äôs leaders should honour his and John Hume‚Äôs legacy.  He negotiated for peace, won peace and may he now rest in peace. https://t.co/E1FljRk3VA
1551611615921020934	2022-07-25 16:53:31+00:00	On July 27th 1922 my grandfather escaped from Dundalk Jail through a hole blown in the wall by the Anti-Treaty IRA which can still be seen today.   I plan to head up on Wednesday to mark the 100th anniversary.  If any other families of escapees happen to be around let me know. https://t.co/sPSKMMKvSR

1551161126754439168	2022-07-24 11:03:26+00:00	Best wishes to Kerry &amp; Galway fans today.  Kerry could easily win by 10 or lose by 2. If it‚Äôs tight in the last ten it‚Äôll be fascinating to watch as Kerry have struggled to win close finals since 2002.  Kerry probably deserve it but if Galway win you‚Äôd have to feel for Mayo. https://t.co/4CUJW60Jd1
