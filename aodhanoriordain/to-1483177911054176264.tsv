Irish education is just unwaveringly conservative &amp; resistant to change if they can avoid it.

1484163865764052996	2022-01-20 14:00:14+00:00	Happy birthday to our beloved @clodaghhhh in the @labour press office (who actually helped draft this statement). üéÇ https://t.co/RSY6Z1rpzx
1484114486265057284	2022-01-20 10:44:01+00:00	Proud of my @labour colleagues for publishing and tabling this important piece of legislation. https://t.co/3vupT2DRtu
1484087783320961027	2022-01-20 08:57:55+00:00	@LoveCycling Hi Ciar√°n. We are working on such a proposal. Will be publishing in the coming period.
1484080710638088193	2022-01-20 08:29:48+00:00	Listening to An Taoiseach on @morningireland re: #HybridLC2022.  Certainly no sense that Govt are welded to traditional leaving cert for 2022.  Hopeful that clarity can be provided today after meeting of education partners. Students need a final answer ASAP.
1483913239264174080	2022-01-19 21:24:20+00:00	Really chuffed with these two matchworn @SportingFingal shirts that arrived today.  Anyone out there who can help fill a few gaps in the LOI collection please let me know!   #GreatestLeagueInTheWorld https://t.co/LLCIZehR49
1483891044089569284	2022-01-19 19:56:08+00:00	A big thank you to all those students campaigning for #HybridLC2022.  The @OCO_ireland has joined the call &amp; @alankellylabour questioned the Taoiseach on it today.  We‚Äôll know more tomorrow but keep the faith!   We‚Äôve been at this since July so if it takes another week so be it. https://t.co/1U9ZxTjksO
1483881195238793216	2022-01-19 19:17:00+00:00	My colleague @alankellylabour is absolutely right. We‚Äôve been calling for #HybridLC22 since last July. https://t.co/0qSLR2fHjb
1483871409633902599	2022-01-19 18:38:07+00:00	@AnneRabbitte @CraftyReporter Well done for highlighting Minister. We do unfortunately have a long way to go.
1483868124332052481	2022-01-19 18:25:04+00:00	Crazy. https://t.co/Wq8AYrEqni
1483864665209950210	2022-01-19 18:11:19+00:00	This quote shows a fundamental &amp; I believe a deliberate misrepresentation of what #decrim means.  ‚û°Ô∏èPutting legalisation in the same sentence.  ‚û°Ô∏è Referencing a particular substance, rather than the person.  Fast losing patience with this. https://t.co/UXSmlFaYAl

1483763051119656963	2022-01-19 11:27:33+00:00	Please listen to what @SenLynnRuane said at Health Committee today.   Not good enough for Minister to criticise ‚ÄòWar on Drugs‚Äô but then to continue it.  We need Citizens Assembly on Drugs but not along same outdated moralistic lines.

1483718127867379717	2022-01-19 08:29:02+00:00	This is utterly heartbreaking. The pain is palpable. The sectarian element is particularly poisonous. Some young men have a lot on their conscience over what happened to Eden. https://t.co/CuATpPW7ZR

1483360606115799040	2022-01-18 08:48:22+00:00	My Admission to Schools Bill will be debated at Committee Stage today.  It removes right of schools to prioritise enrollment of children &amp; grandchildren of past-pupils.  It shouldn't matter what school your parents went to.
