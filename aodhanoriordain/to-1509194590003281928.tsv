1516138547811655691	2022-04-18 19:36:12+00:00	For those of us who want to see a United Ireland in our lifetime, the sight of people marching in balaclavas and others throwing bottles at police vans makes that possibility less likely.  I hope they might learn that.
1516099947095109633	2022-04-18 17:02:49+00:00	@conanbyrnecb7 @DavidSneyd Yep. I rustled Nutsy’s hair after the fourth goal when he stood on the railings. (My claim to fame - it’s in the TV clip)
1516097929777401869	2022-04-18 16:54:48+00:00	@conanbyrnecb7 @DavidSneyd Last time Bohs beat Shels 4-1 in Tolka? Was it 1992?
1516084844631056385	2022-04-18 16:02:49+00:00	Very impressive speech from @INTOnews President Joe McKeown at #INTOCongress2022 this afternoon.  An address that any trade unionist would be proud of.   Looking forward to attending @astiunion conference tomorrow. https://t.co/paTvjS6tx3

1516023794208591872	2022-04-18 12:00:13+00:00	The revelation that the Shels-Bohs match I bought a ticket for (which it turns out has 3pm written on it) is actually kicking off at 3pm upsets me greatly.  I demand an enquiry as I now can’t go as I assumed it would be at 7.45pm.   😡
1515956425633247233	2022-04-18 07:32:31+00:00	@colmjoconnor @jonnyfallon @1916FourCourts He was only a kid.

1515949930241798152	2022-04-18 07:06:43+00:00	In Heuston Station on the way to #INTOCongress2022.

But tonight there was solidarity, love &amp; determination.  If you feel vulnerable because of who you are, there is an army across Ireland ready to embrace you. https://t.co/2liVXFnR0j https://t.co/BGp10BNOu1

1514268938930171911	2022-04-13 15:47:03+00:00	In Feb govt announced package to ease cost-of-living crisis.   More measures were announced today.   Last week I asked Tánaiste for emergency budget but idea was dismissed as 'sloganeering' (debate below).  As @geraldnash said today, October's budget must now be brought forward. https://t.co/Ir5H52NUNH

1514171443688484864	2022-04-13 09:19:38+00:00	We’re in a low pay epidemic.  23% of workers are in low pay employment, the 3rd highest proportion of low pay workers in the OECD.  The FG proposal of a 5 year lead-in for a living wage is ridiculous.   Well said @marie_sherlock on @TodaywithClaire.
1514144268482404359	2022-04-13 07:31:39+00:00	Well spoken @BlaineSligo on @morningireland about the chilling events in Sligo.  At this time we can only extend sympathies to the family and friends of Aidan Moffitt &amp; the other man found this morning.  We thought we had come so far.
1513949140551667732	2022-04-12 18:36:17+00:00	@emernowlan Wrecked I’d say Emer. They could easily have folded after the equaliser though. 💪

A true leader, she fought &amp; won many battles for her community.  Deirdre’s passing will be mourned by all who knew her. Deepest sympathies from @LabourDBN to her family. https://t.co/QDr0pJN48D

1509539857789603846	2022-03-31 14:35:22+00:00	Today I asked @EamonRyan to meet Energy Regulator (CRU) to demand they follow UK’s example in tackling energy prices.  UK’s OFGEM demand all customers are moved to cheaper deals offered to new customers.  Our @labour bill in 2020 was aimed at same result: https://t.co/KwHU88zPc0 https://t.co/BAWOPcJfYh
1509499724302372869	2022-03-31 11:55:54+00:00	It has come to my notice that Ukrainian refugee teachers are being charged €390 to register with the @TeachingCouncil.  Given the urgent need for language support in our schools for Ukrainian children, I have written to the Education Minister asking for this fee to be waived.
