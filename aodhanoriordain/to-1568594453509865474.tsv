1575028486267289600	2022-09-28 07:43:48+00:00	T√°naiste on @morningireland laying groundwork for mini-budget like I said yesterday.  Once-off measures will be forgotten in January when families, schools &amp; businesses struggle with bills.  ‚Ç¨190 for lower paid workers Vs ‚Ç¨830 for higher earners will look even more stupid then. https://t.co/B2OHIZNmwW

1574878589127999488	2022-09-27 21:48:10+00:00	I just got confused by someone for @EamonRyan in Leinster House‚Ä¶even though I was standing right beside @EamonRyan at the time‚Ä¶  I clearly look more like @EamonRyan than @EamonRyan does.  (Btw reader‚Ä¶this happens to me at least once a week‚Ä¶.)

Time for Irish fans who only follow English teams to cop on &amp; realise they‚Äôre part of the problem.  Irish football matters but it‚Äôs been unloved for generations by those who pretend to care for it.  #InKennyWeTrust

1574777779337543680	2022-09-27 15:07:35+00:00	On education let‚Äôs be clear:  ‚úÖ Free schoolbooks &amp; PTR reduction at primary level is welcome  ‚ùå But no capitation increase is baffling &amp; crippling for schools across the country.  ‚ùå Also second level is ignored where the costs are most acute  ‚ùå Missed opportunity‚Ä¶again..

1574744997341016064	2022-09-27 12:57:19+00:00	Confusing as to why the outline of capitation increases aren‚Äôt outlined rather than announcing a total fund and including it with school transport cost. https://t.co/G1VLZKk9lQ https://t.co/MwV9ji9URf
