It‚Äôs signed by some of the squad &amp; now by Schillachi. https://t.co/9nmd2gLyI5
1611468614527496193	2023-01-06 21:03:51+00:00	Qualification for the 1990 World Cup was effectively secured by beating Northern Ireland 3-0 at Lansdowne Road.  Nigel Worthington wore this that day. https://t.co/tTBwJJxWXV

1610253439073923076	2023-01-03 12:35:11+00:00	Have to agree with @jenhoganjourno here. Too much rancour &amp; upset in homes &amp; classrooms undermining what should be the joy of learning. Read with your children - that‚Äôs the priority - not stressful homework. https://t.co/BLivJuAxHk
