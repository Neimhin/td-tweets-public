Whether it’s because always have past-pupils at cabinet or not, they regularly get what they want.  Classic example was School Admissions Act 2018. https://t.co/ucLhuhoK0u

We  don’t have a proactive &amp; caring Education Dept / Minister.  It seems enough for them to have opened schools.   Simply not good enough.  3/3

Secondly the issue is of availability of teachers, not the rate of recovery of students. Thirdly - spend some time talking to 6th year students like I do.
1481198048780992512	2022-01-12 09:35:08+00:00	@Flyck66 @dulchiewhelan So he’ll know where the teacher unions stand on this? Seeing as you don’t?
1481204680176906241	2022-01-12 10:01:29+00:00	@Flyck66 @dulchiewhelan So in summary: You don’t know what the issue is really about. You don’t know what the stance of the various players actually is. And you made a crass assumption as to what my motivation was. And you decided to do all this in a public forum. Oh dear.

1482796438832783366	2022-01-16 19:26:34+00:00	@NiecyOKeeffe @LindaTutty Yeah mainly an urban phenomenon and absolutely a legacy issue but 17% of Irish children attend single gender primary schools. Parents in my experience are anxious to amalgamate schools but process is slow. Dept haven’t sanctioned a new single gender school since 1998.

For €100million Govt could make every schoolbook for every child free &amp; end the practice of Voluntary Contributions.  Too many conversations between parents and schools are about money.  Govt chose €500m in tax cuts instead. https://t.co/9laOsxwhq2

1487874299318919171	2022-01-30 19:44:10+00:00	Small story from yesterday. 1/2  Driving through Marino singing &amp; waving my hands (while on steering wheel) with 3 yr old in the back.  She’s waving &amp; singing at top of her voice.  We stopped at lights outside @sweeneysD3 &amp; young couple spotted us &amp; started waving their arms too.
1487874301722255364	2022-01-30 19:44:11+00:00	2/2  3 yr old couldn’t believe it.  Then older couple saw what was happening &amp; started waving their arms as well.   3 yr old now absolutely enthralled.  So off we went loving the fact that random strangers wanted to share a moment with her.  And that’s why Dublin is awesome. ❤️

Govt must act on the goodwill of the opposition &amp; establish the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs.  Lives are at stake.   Problem is the value placed on those lives isn't high enough. #DECRIM https://t.co/5LgPfPpky8

The children and their families need support as do our teachers, SNAs and school communities.

Before the pandemic Ireland had 3rd highest proportion of workers on low pay in the OECD.  23% of Ireland’s full-time workforce was on low pay,  representing around 100,000 workers - disproportionately women. https://t.co/pFokwj5uv1

1524043896296288257	2022-05-10 15:09:14+00:00	The maintenance of the 9% VAT rate for hospitality sector is welcome.  However workers in this sector are 3 times more likely to be the minimum wage.  Govt must demand of these employers to engage properly with the JLC structures that they veto far too often. https://t.co/JH9qrptF6w

Govt still refuse to remove the elitist provision in School Admissions Act which gives more rights to children &amp; grandchildren of past-pupils.

I plan to head up on Wednesday to mark the 100th anniversary.  If any other families of escapees happen to be around let me know. https://t.co/sPSKMMKvSR

Collins was apparently told about a potential assassin who was loitering outside the house.  Collins would be killed 5 days later in Cork. https://t.co/SQ2r0A87VG
1559894840279695363	2022-08-17 13:28:06+00:00	@131Weeks I knew there was some connection between Collins and that house and it was suggested to me that he used it as a safe house during the WOI. Good to have the link confirmed.

No ambition for Irish education, no acknowledgement of stresses within the system - consistent ‘it’s grand’ approach.  Schools crying out for leadership from their minister. Sadly lacking.
1564156300933701634	2022-08-29 07:41:37+00:00	No-one expects Minister to have all the answers but do we demand effort:  ❌ No ambition on class size ❌ No acknowledgment of school transport mess as outlined by @seansherlocktd  ❌ No vision for free books scheme ❌ No vision to help teachers / SNAs afford to work in Dublin
1564156958952890368	2022-08-29 07:44:14+00:00	❌ No recognition that many SEN children still have no place for this school year ❌ No plan to address learning gap caused by COVID which has profoundly affected thousands of students   Stop fire-fighting &amp; excusing.  System needs leadership now.

1574737542011764739	2022-09-27 12:27:41+00:00	Early examination of the budget documentation has no mention of increased capitation for schools.  Am assuming it is listed elsewhere but if it has been overlooked it’s a major omission.  #budget2023 https://t.co/dmuHjeELsi
1574744997341016064	2022-09-27 12:57:19+00:00	Confusing as to why the outline of capitation increases aren’t outlined rather than announcing a total fund and including it with school transport cost. https://t.co/G1VLZKk9lQ https://t.co/MwV9ji9URf
1574747025467375617	2022-09-27 13:05:22+00:00	School funding measure is a disgrace.  No increase in capitation rates - just throwing a once off package at it.  Nothing sustainable in that - Taoiseach promised a move on capitation and it hasn’t happened.  #Budget2023

1574777779337543680	2022-09-27 15:07:35+00:00	On education let’s be clear:  ✅ Free schoolbooks &amp; PTR reduction at primary level is welcome  ❌ But no capitation increase is baffling &amp; crippling for schools across the country.  ❌ Also second level is ignored where the costs are most acute  ❌ Missed opportunity…again..
1574852522245820432	2022-09-27 20:04:35+00:00	Heartbreaking for the u21s to lose on a penalty shootout but what a campaign and a fantastic group of young men.  So proud of them.  They’ve so much more to achieve.  It’ll sound hollow right now but they should be damn proud of themselves.  #COYBIG
1574864237075243013	2022-09-27 20:51:08+00:00	Football is clearly better. Team is young, united &amp; progressing.  Time for Irish fans who only follow English teams to cop on &amp; realise they’re part of the problem.

The Dept is historically resistant to accepting responsibility for running of schools - feels it’s constitutionally the role of patron bodies.

I don’t blame FG/FF Cllrs but those masquerading as left wing just handed €375 to every owner of a million euro house.  If there’s no money for your playground, park or library next year this is why.

1579870948333080577	2022-10-11 16:26:01+00:00	Last year govt spent €95m of a ring-fenced levy on Horse &amp; Greyhound fund.  Tiny fraction of it could support central contract scheme for players in women’s game here to build up a domestic football industry.  Women’s football is still amateur - the game deserves better. #COYGIG https://t.co/JusTQ2asLn

1610190934796390400	2023-01-03 08:26:49+00:00	So sorry to hear this Johnny. Deepest condolences to you and to our wider family. https://t.co/cLqCQAox81

1610253439073923076	2023-01-03 12:35:11+00:00	Have to agree with @jenhoganjourno here. Too much rancour &amp; upset in homes &amp; classrooms undermining what should be the joy of learning. Read with your children - that’s the priority - not stressful homework. https://t.co/BLivJuAxHk
1610275555185655810	2023-01-03 14:03:04+00:00	My colleague @DuncanSmithTD is absolutely correct here - where is the political leadership?  Difference between this and the Christmas crib response is stark. https://t.co/M6uKNDKcXz

1610752810634858498	2023-01-04 21:39:31+00:00	Disgusting behaviour. Absolute solidarity with Anne and the other person assaulted. Why would we encourage anyone to enter politics with abuse like that from those who can’t handle civilised debate? https://t.co/Oznkagim2h
1610914738375983104	2023-01-05 08:22:57+00:00	Best wishes to all school communities returning today!

1611462591733178398	2023-01-06 20:39:56+00:00	Hanging out with Schillachi last night got me chatting with a few people about my jersey collection so I thought I’d throw a few up here in a thread.  Here are the Ireland themed ones anyway…. 1/Infinity&amp;Beyond https://t.co/p1Glzh1UJD
1611467744666390529	2023-01-06 21:00:24+00:00	This is from the first big win of the Charlton era in 1987: a 1-0 away win against Scotland with @MTLawrenson scoring.  Shirt belongs to Murdo McLeod who was at Celtic at the time.  Of course Scotland helped us qualify for Euro 88 by beating Bulgaria away in the last game. https://t.co/qIuCibGBS7
1611468041824489483	2023-01-06 21:01:35+00:00	Niall Quinn was issued this shirt for a famous win against Brazil in 1987 which was my first game.  It’s probably my favourite Ireland jersey. https://t.co/j65ZyeTInH
1611468283617726473	2023-01-06 21:02:33+00:00	Onto the campaign for Italia ‘90 and @Paulmcgrath5 wore this in the 1-0 in over Spain in April 1989. https://t.co/usDHaYPjza
1611468614527496193	2023-01-06 21:03:51+00:00	Qualification for the 1990 World Cup was effectively secured by beating Northern Ireland 3-0 at Lansdowne Road.  Nigel Worthington wore this that day. https://t.co/tTBwJJxWXV
1611469101976936448	2023-01-06 21:05:48+00:00	I love the story behind this one.  David O’Leary wore it in a pre-tournament friendly in Malta.  He probably thought it would be his only involvement on the trip. It almost was only for an injury to Staunton against Romania!  It’s signed by some of the squad &amp; now by Schillachi. https://t.co/9nmd2gLyI5
1611469324618993664	2023-01-06 21:06:41+00:00	This is a training bib from Italy that Schillachi also signed. https://t.co/eH5crcZl0b
1611469563572506634	2023-01-06 21:07:38+00:00	The Euro ‘92 campaign didn’t work out mainly because of a home 0-0 draw with Poland.  Tony Cascarino wore this shirt that day. https://t.co/Qpu0uXI5YZ
1611469951814205442	2023-01-06 21:09:10+00:00	Then onto the World Cup campaign for USA 94.  This is a Denis Irwin shirt from the away win in Latvia. https://t.co/FPi9XTmuUw
1611470136677916672	2023-01-06 21:09:54+00:00	Lithuania arrived in Dublin needed an emergency set of gear before we beat them 2-0. https://t.co/S3ezEm576H
1611470431692677122	2023-01-06 21:11:05+00:00	And the qualification was secured with a 1-1 draw in Belfast in a nasty game.  This is a squad shirt from the game. https://t.co/nerIoWSzAq
1611470777055956998	2023-01-06 21:12:27+00:00	This is a USA ‘94 World Cup shirt issued to David Kelly. https://t.co/JHgKTvggBn

1611473291872555012	2023-01-06 21:22:27+00:00	Euro ‘96 didn’t work out and a home draw against Northern Ireland didn’t help. This is a @MCATEER4 shirt from that game. https://t.co/EI5tg3izjC
1611473668713992196	2023-01-06 21:23:57+00:00	The ultimate disaster came against Liechtenstein in a 0-0 away draw which ended qualification hopes.  This is a quirky one to have but it’s a bit of history. https://t.co/NZ6rxi4w7S
1611473990215733249	2023-01-06 21:25:13+00:00	Shirts got a bit 👀 in the late 90s and this was from the World Cup ‘98 campaign. https://t.co/gsZIrHpNtH
1611474323952254976	2023-01-06 21:26:33+00:00	Euro ‘00 campaign ended with a disaster play off against Turkey.  This is a @TonyCascarino62 shirt from the home leg. https://t.co/NSql3GZlF6
1611474829827362818	2023-01-06 21:28:33+00:00	World Cup 2002 campaign was a success.  Drawing 2-2 away to the Netherlands was a decent start even if we were 2-0 up.  @MrDavidConnolly wore this shirt that night. https://t.co/KNATaghYSj
1611475124519145473	2023-01-06 21:29:44+00:00	I love this one as it the final qualifying game against Cyprus and it’s signed by the whole squad including Roy. https://t.co/CzuV5uLBIv
1611475377938890752	2023-01-06 21:30:44+00:00	New campaign for Euro ‘04 and a new tent of a shirt. https://t.co/UjYnqclmXn

1611477228554178561	2023-01-06 21:38:05+00:00	World Cup 2006 campaign was all about France and here’s a Joe Murphy goalkeeper shirt from the 0-0 draw in Paris. https://t.co/J6OzhDahPe
1611477531491979264	2023-01-06 21:39:17+00:00	Home loss to France kinda ended it.  This was a @kdkilbane77 jersey from that game. https://t.co/RVc1hOFjcI

1611478949086875669	2023-01-06 21:44:55+00:00	So the Euro 2008 effort was a bit grim.  None grimmer than the 5-2 loss to Cyprus. https://t.co/kz6hxJS5KY
1611479248820133890	2023-01-06 21:46:07+00:00	Although a bit of history was made by playing our first game in Croke Park (which featured a 17 year old Gareth Bale).  Won it 1-0. https://t.co/i4dHOtoUvL
1611479543461695500	2023-01-06 21:47:17+00:00	Trapattoni took over for the World Cup 2010 campaign and we got a good 1-1 in Italy. https://t.co/pdcOo2nKrn
1611479754565378049	2023-01-06 21:48:07+00:00	Should have beaten Bulgaria but we didn’t. This is a @stephenhunt1010 shirt from that game. https://t.co/YxeSHWE4jL
1611480490212745219	2023-01-06 21:51:03+00:00	And then a last minute equaliser in Croker after @seanstledger12 had given us a 2-1 lead was a heartbreaker.  Palombo wore this shirt that night. https://t.co/nEEhbnD5rC
1611481092762095638	2023-01-06 21:53:27+00:00	Don’t need to say too much about the play-off against France.  Lost the home leg 1-0 and this is the jersey Joe Murphy was issued.  Away leg was turned by the Henry handball etc etc https://t.co/ovxKIQXg3e
1611481485772574737	2023-01-06 21:55:00+00:00	We qualified for the 2012 European Championship.  @KevinDoyle1983 was issued this shirt for the home game against Macedonia. https://t.co/M79GTpD48i

1611483078106533905	2023-01-06 22:01:20+00:00	The Euro 2012 tournament wasn’t great. Played three and lost three.  Richard Dunne was issued this shirt for the Croatia game. https://t.co/EaJl9lt7dB

1611487758182240269	2023-01-06 22:19:56+00:00	Euro 2016 was great.  Greatest night was the 1-0 win against Germany. https://t.co/E8Fac65NFF
1611488151817670656	2023-01-06 22:21:30+00:00	Play-off win against Bosnia was fantastic.  Here’s the shirt Dzeko wore in Dublin when we qualified. https://t.co/2yhPUQT2t6
1611488626382196764	2023-01-06 22:23:23+00:00	The tournament itself was made with a 1-0 win against Italy.  And I’m chuffed to have this Immobile jersey from that historic night. https://t.co/ZZMzbnvf98
1611489533341896705	2023-01-06 22:26:59+00:00	World Cup 2018 was a tournament we should have qualified for.  Started with a 2-2 draw in Serbia.  Here’s a Wes shirt from that game. https://t.co/3BW1jC0wRc

Anyone who can help fill gaps (away shirts &amp; most recent jersey) I’d love to chat. I use them for @FootballTourDub &amp; school talks about Irish football history.  This is the centenary game shirt. https://t.co/GN1VTbhf7R

1612422471189241856	2023-01-09 12:14:09+00:00	Let’s face it.   All schools should be multidenominational.   Separating children on the basis of religion has no place in an egalitarian education system in a country that calls itself a Republic. https://t.co/bOPPLFTg60

Anyone protesting this week over a non-existent DP centre don’t have a clue what they’re talking about.  #IrelandIsFull of misinformation it would appear. https://t.co/FmvTWruKen

1618590015675826177	2023-01-26 12:41:46+00:00	This is absolutely necessary.  Too many family conversations about school are actually about money.  In NI all schoolbooks are free. They should be free in the Republic for every family. https://t.co/JdD8MdOdhE
1618633294945587200	2023-01-26 15:33:44+00:00	Labour supports the use of body-cams for Gardaí but will demand tight regulations regarding the storage of such recording &amp; its sharing.  The leaking or inappropriate sharing of sensitive material cannot become a side effect of the advent of Garda body-cams. https://t.co/p8SIGxLBtL
1618700869029236737	2023-01-26 20:02:15+00:00	Great to see so many new members at our @labourdbn AGM. https://t.co/qSM4VMuKCR

1620018876665978880	2023-01-30 11:19:33+00:00	Dept of Finance confirms to me by means of reply to Parliamentary Question that SNAs “do not come within the scope of the Flat Rate Expenses regime” as teachers do.  #RespectForSNAs @forsa_union_ie https://t.co/UtcAG8mBA8
1620146567012556800	2023-01-30 19:46:57+00:00	Many Dubs know how it feels when people think the worst of you, cos of where you're from.  We can't let facts be twisted &amp; turn against people we don't know, just cos we don't know them.  We can campaign for housing, Gardaí &amp; community facilities from those who can deliver them.
1620154249509486592	2023-01-30 20:17:28+00:00	How many families remember calls for ‘vetting’ when they tried to access council housing over the years?  Migrant &amp; non-white workers now tell me they feel uncomfortable cos of the recent atmosphere that’s been created.  We all have to be better than this.

Blacks out was shouted, gobshites in balaclavas &amp; abused two poor girls waiting on the bus because they weren't Irish”

1621083989388689409	2023-02-02 09:51:56+00:00	One rally last night had children in school uniforms join the chorus of ‘out, out, out’.  Another rally had a speaker shouting ‘burn them out’.  And a Senator under privilege in the chamber decided to question the veracity of the Ashtown story &amp; the agenda of the journalist. https://t.co/P1upHUVxxd

No reflection whatsoever on the staff member who was following policy…but for an industry that can invent a million ways to screw you over, printing something out for you is seemingly beyond them.

1623391988530683912	2023-02-08 18:43:05+00:00	My interaction with the Minister at the Education Committee this evening in a 🧵.  Firstly it appears the LC2023 results date will be similar to LC2022 which is disappointing to hear to say the least.
1623391991856873475	2023-02-08 18:43:06+00:00	Asked Minister to consider a reconfigured DEIS scheme which identifies acutely disadvantaged schools &amp; resources them accordingly. Minister listened to my suggestion.
1623391994662846468	2023-02-08 18:43:07+00:00	Free primary schoolbook rollout info will be made available to schools before Easter &amp; schools will retain autonomy on book suppliers etc. Impressed on Minister need for every school to participate - not an ‘opt in’ model.
1623392001306550278	2023-02-08 18:43:08+00:00	School transport review nearing completion- need to know asap about September 2023
1623391997942763527	2023-02-08 18:43:08+00:00	Schools will be informed in the coming weeks if they will participate in the €5m mental health counselling programme due to commence in Sept. Model to be used being finalised currently.

1623392006792790018	2023-02-08 18:43:10+00:00	Lastly raised issue of primary school reconfiguration and specifically Raheny. Process is ongoing but Minister did state that ‘potential parents’ need to be included.
