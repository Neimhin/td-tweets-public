1583118091709743104	2022-10-20 15:29:00+00:00	I keep thinking about this tweet, partly because it is not untypical behaviour.  But also because 1000s of Somali children are starving from a drought brought on by climate change.   If hatred of cycle lanes is what motivates you, you‚Äôve no idea how lucky you are. https://t.co/Jx3PBffjrz

1582674717357445120	2022-10-19 10:07:11+00:00	Disgusting rhetoric from a govt TD.  Punching down on those who need compassion &amp; support by using dehumanised terminology is disgusting.  I challenge @campaign4kehoe to visit some Addiction Services &amp; to learn how unacceptable his language is.   Maybe their lives have no value? https://t.co/jg4fdtEnfC
