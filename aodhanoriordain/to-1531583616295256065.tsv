1532090830231584768	2022-06-01 20:04:53+00:00	Gov Chief Whip confirmed today no Special Education debate tomorrow.  There are statements on Higher Ed which no one asked for.  Mins Foley &amp; Madigan were at Education Committee for only 45 mins today to discuss other issues.  100s of children still have no school place for Sept.

1531583616295256065	2022-05-31 10:29:24+00:00	The SNA allocations debacle goes to the heart of the disrespect shown to those who work with the most vulnerable in our education system.  They are being shown borderline contempt.  Last day of May and if you‚Äôre an SNA you‚Äôve still no idea what you‚Äôll be doing in September.
