1476974811440103429	2021-12-31 17:53:30+00:00	New Year request to any matchworn shirt collectors or even players!  Have managed to collect a player’s shirt (match worn / issued) in every men’s jersey we’ve had since 1986…  Apart from one….the 2019 dark green version.  Anyone who can help me out drop me a DM? Thanks. 🇮🇪 https://t.co/6cc9VNYSQv

I wrote to her on Nov 16th to seek such a meeting &amp; none has taken place, or is planned.  It’s not just disrespectful to those who want to work in partnership, it illustrates again that the Dept won’t listen. https://t.co/XuXTZvEo2u

1476581720291831810	2021-12-30 15:51:30+00:00	Absence of leadership in education again.  Dept must know there is uncertainty in school communities.  They must now: ➡️ Roll out LC2022 like 2021 ➡️ Protect staff &amp; students effectively ➡️ Launch public awareness campaign re: child vaccination  Otherwise they lose control again. https://t.co/qbWCLyRnpS

1475438157936136198	2021-12-27 12:07:23+00:00	What lies behind this story is the hugely disproportionate influence fee-paying sector has on political system &amp; education policy.  Whether it’s because always have past-pupils at cabinet or not, they regularly get what they want.  Classic example was School Admissions Act 2018. https://t.co/ucLhuhoK0u
