There is more buzz around domestic game than there has been since I began following it 30 years ago.  However Euro 2028 feels like a distraction from hard work that needs to be done.  Happy to be proved wrong.

Culturally the Irish obsession with English football continues.  But there are positives:  This game changes more lives &amp; lifts more people on the margins than any other.

Before the pandemic Ireland had 3rd highest proportion of workers on low pay in the OECD.  23% of Ireland‚Äôs full-time workforce was on low pay,  representing around 100,000 workers - disproportionately women. https://t.co/pFokwj5uv1

1503022018932862980	2022-03-13 14:55:48+00:00	There‚Äôs a time for politics &amp; a time to echo the sentiments of an Irish leader on the international stage speaking with compassion &amp; decency.  We should expect no less of an Irish leader given our history but it should be applauded none the less.  üáÆüá™ üá∫üá¶    https://t.co/28TyVjkAa4

Likely I‚Äôll get to ask about: ‚û°Ô∏è Expansion of pilot free books scheme  ‚û°Ô∏è Publication of staff schedule for 2022/23.  You can watch debate on @OireachtasNews live stream.
1501589016168349699	2022-03-09 16:01:34+00:00	Earlier today I asked the Taoiseach about Ukrainian children entering our school system and the supports they and their schools will need.  The education system must also support existing Ukrainian &amp; Russian families in our school communities through this traumatic period. https://t.co/CGzCLgiU7r
1501588053709795332	2022-03-09 15:57:44+00:00	Delighted to see @StDavidsBNS included on expanded DEIS list.  I met with principal Mr Moore last month on the matter &amp; wrote to Minister Foley on behalf of the school.   As the only school locally without DEIS status it's only fitting they will now receive extra supports. https://t.co/w0rI1oJfpR
