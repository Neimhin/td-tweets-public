1458502217154052096	2021-11-10 18:30:00+00:00	This is very important. Too much of the climate debate has focussed on carbon tax. Carbon tax will never deliver the type and scale of change required. If recent IPCC reports and #COP26 have taught us anything, it's that state's must lead and they must act now. https://t.co/sOJ1bbxgPK

1458033752844668932	2021-11-09 11:28:30+00:00	@DanielTMurray @PaulDonnellySF That's not the impression I got from the Dept (EU Comms) or Minister (Revised Estimates) at Committee hearings @DanielTMurray, but time will tell. Either way, there's a question mark over projected carbon tax receipts. A significant one, in my opinion.
1458017449316700161	2021-11-09 10:23:43+00:00	Terrible news for many communities. Government seem intent on abandoning rail.

1458008738837811202	2021-11-09 09:49:06+00:00	Assumptions that €9.5bn will be raised from carbon tax by 2030 are built on sand. The state is facing the very real prospect of losing 70-80% of carbon tax income due to EU 'Fit for 55' proposals.   I'm surprised there's not more commentary on this. Seems important to me.... https://t.co/dSqCb3w0Jb

Many (the poor and working families struggling to make ends meet - particuarly those in 'high risk' areas) lose out....again. https://t.co/7SrDWgQYxI
1447157237445713923	2021-10-10 11:09:06+00:00	In advance of their defence of hiking Carbon Tax on Tues, it's worth pointing out that in 2019 Govt. committed to retrofitting 500k homes by 2030 - so about 50k a year.   To mid-Sept, they've 5,600 completed in 2021. At this rate, they'll miss their target by &gt;40k at year's end.
