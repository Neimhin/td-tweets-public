State companies can play a leading role in the transition to a low carbon economy but they need to be empowered (as do planning and regulatory authorities).   https://t.co/JgVJa7YKmv

Targets were significantly reduced (e.g. from 115k to 60k by 31.01.22).   Project is way off target (even revised targets) &amp; at current rate it will be Dec before 60k premises are passed.
1511981678650179590	2022-04-07 08:18:18+00:00	Lest there be any confusion, @sinnfeinireland SUPPORT the carbon budgets - (the CCAC's best estimate to reduce emissions by 2030). We have articulated this in the D√°il &amp; at Cttee.  Some in the media seem intent on conflating carbon budgets with carbon tax. I don't know why...
