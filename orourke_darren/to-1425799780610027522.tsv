As a result of this (and Govt’s failure to prepare) thousands of children are refused places.   🚌 This is hugely frustrating for families trying to make arrangements for the school year. https://t.co/YDbF722SWe

Many taxi drivers (like arts/ents &amp; others) are not back at work because there is no work - due to ongoing restrictions.
