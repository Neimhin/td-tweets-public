1559836788751048704	2022-08-17 09:37:25+00:00	📻 I was on Morning Ireland on RTÉ Radio 1 this morning to discuss the whitewash that is the Navan Hospital 'review'. Have a listen back here. 👇  https://t.co/erbzmrXfaJ
1559496331051376642	2022-08-16 11:04:34+00:00	The Terms of Reference of the Navan Hospital review (just now published) confirming that the possibility of investing in and keeping the A&amp;E open WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. Outrageous. #SaveNavanHospital https://t.co/ygNmiGdCKe
1559479587968585729	2022-08-16 09:58:02+00:00	This ‘review’ has all the makings of a whitewash. Window-dressing to deliver on the HSE’s intention to close Navan A&amp;E. (They aren’t even considering an option that keeps the A&amp;E open!). And all under the watchful eye of Fianna Fáil &amp; Fine Gael. Disgrace.  https://t.co/ALbDxqWQXN
1559074633298677763	2022-08-15 07:08:53+00:00	I will be on @LMFMRADIO at 9.15am this morning discussing the refusal by Min. Stephen Donnelly and the HSE to give details of the ongoing review into the future of Navan Hospital. Tune in if you can. 📻 https://t.co/hioN5bvYAW
1558828527004393473	2022-08-14 14:50:57+00:00	A great day at Moynalty Steam Threshing. The best and most historic of equipment on display. Great to have a bumper crowd. Well done to all involved. https://t.co/iIg7FH5C6d

1555539710667329537	2022-08-05 13:02:22+00:00	I'm reminded of this👇🏼. We're fortunate to have an incredible wind resource. It can be used to benefit the many or the few. There is a necessary role for the private sector, but FF/FG/Greens are all too comfortable leaving Ireland as a developer's playground. https://t.co/5gYjMXeaa6 https://t.co/s9ONIjhyke
1555522368503676928	2022-08-05 11:53:27+00:00	The government must introduce a WINDFALL TAX on big-profiting energy companies and redirect the money back into people’s pockets.

1554791077151997952	2022-08-03 11:27:34+00:00	Solar PV can help households cut skyrocketing electricity bills while also reducing our emissions.   Scientists at UCC have found that a quarter of all electricity needed by households could be produced by putting solar panels on domestic rooftops.

1554790762931490817	2022-08-03 11:26:19+00:00	This is despite Minister Ryan repeatedly assuring us this scheme would be in place by July.   Those households who installed solar PV deserve to get paid now for the renewable energy they are sending to the grid. (2/6)   https://t.co/EkHVCLRFgU
1554790566201786369	2022-08-03 11:25:32+00:00	This week I contacted the 12 main electricity suppliers here to ask if they are paying microgenerators for the renewable energy they are sending to the grid.   Only 2 confirmed they were.   Most said they have not even decided what unit rate they will pay yet.
