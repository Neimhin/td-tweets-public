1471460281578622982	2021-12-16 12:40:44+00:00	A good report. The Circular Economy (avoid, reduce, reuse, recycle) will be an essential element of our collective climate action.   Govt. should heed Committee recommendations and introduce legislation and enabling schemes as a matter of priority. https://t.co/BQQlTPqbtg
1471138583612436480	2021-12-15 15:22:25+00:00	National Broadband Ireland has target of passing 60k premises by end Jan 2022 (reduced from 115,000).   It won't make it but Govt won't admit it.   Note language in PQ reply👇🏼: 35k passed by end of year. 50k-60k available to order or PRE-ORDER (!!) by end of year.   #Debacle https://t.co/YbX8fbMqVQ
1471050625731416068	2021-12-15 09:32:54+00:00	€100 electricity credit will be welcome, but people need it before Christmas (and it needs to be part of a wider suite of measures to tackle fuel &amp; energy poverty &amp; runaway utility bills).   At this rate it will be late Spring before it's introduced, thanks to deliberate delay.. https://t.co/Fv2Hx0cam5
1470769712669810692	2021-12-14 14:56:39+00:00	Govt. plans for €100 support for household energy bills won’t, now, materialise until the New Year (&amp; paid in Mar/Apr!) and look set to be limited to electricity.   People need this support before Christmas. Dáil should meet to facilitate passage of legislation.

1470746678789562375	2021-12-14 13:25:08+00:00	Today, Oireachtas members were briefed on the urgent need for a #TRIPSwaiver, how the EU (incl. Ireland) are the main roadblock, &amp; how the EU tactic is to use its counter-proposal as a stalling mechanism.  Last week, I challenged the Tánaiste on this. His response was telling... https://t.co/oyNl99gTd0

Please support this important Bill &amp; help prevent homelessness this Christmas.  #HousingCrisis #BacktheBill #SinnFéin https://t.co/FgZchaA8ON

1470084130151055367	2021-12-12 17:32:24+00:00	What the polls show is a growing appetite for change that hasn't gone away and an enormous dissatisfaction with Government.  We are here to build a new and united Ireland in our time.   #Time4Change #TWIP https://t.co/jVgT5fhmTd
1470021932473102338	2021-12-12 13:25:15+00:00	Chaos in Simonstown vaccination centre this morning. Wait times of 2.5 to 3 hours. Centre is closed to traffic now due to delays. Govt and HSE seem intent on undoing the good work of earlier rounds of vaccine rollout. Crazy stuff. https://t.co/f5tYlkUNql

1469687146399289344	2021-12-11 15:14:55+00:00	We need to protect renters from eviction. Please support the Simon Communities Homeless Prevention Bill next week in the Dáil.  Homelessness amongst adults and children has continued to increase.  We need to see more action taken to keep families in their homes. https://t.co/lwULf9LyTo
1469656090782674944	2021-12-11 13:11:31+00:00	Fianna Fáil &amp; Fine Gael are too long in Govt. They have no plan for Ireland. They are out of touch and out of ideas.   On the week that the Climate Advisory Council said we have an “implementation gap”, the Greens can bin the Climate Action Plan at this rate. It’s 6 weeks old!👇 https://t.co/y6JoKdsEl3

It would ensure FULL transparency of ALL payments from pharma to healthcare professionals &amp; organisations here. Current system is wholly inadequate. https://t.co/Me1P6cnj24

1469263320452579332	2021-12-10 11:10:47+00:00	Brought this research to @LeoVaradkar’s attention in the Dáil chamber yesterday. At the time he was too interested in deflection, but he would do well to read it, heed it, and act in response. #TRIPSwaiver https://t.co/k1jqBraYHN

The Irish Government can act but they are deliberately resisting #TRIPSwaiver and completely disingenuous about alternatives.   https://t.co/P3zZ6Vr6vB

1468595053220311040	2021-12-08 14:55:20+00:00	🚖 Clear as mud from the Micheál Martin on supports for taxi drivers today. Absolutely crazy that he points towards Q3 and a economy in “full throttle”. The rug has been pulled from under taxi drivers and they are being denied PUP. https://t.co/9c1BsWSsvU
1468351394260393984	2021-12-07 22:47:07+00:00	Looking forward to raising the need for a #TRIPSwaiver with Leo Varadkar at Minister’s Questions in the Dáil on Thurs.  Irish/EU opposition must end. https://t.co/SEPLMY5hRi

1467515918725095425	2021-12-05 15:27:14+00:00	Paschal Donohoe told @thisweekrte that taxi drivers WOULDN’T be included - “only workers who had lost their JOBS”.   That’s completely outrageous. Many taxi drivers will lose all (or practically all) of their WORK due to new hospitality restrictions.   Govt. MUST include them. https://t.co/g2sQVQKhey

It's shameful and it has to stop.   @AccessToMedsIRL @MSF_access @OxfamIreland @AmnestyIreland @ICCLtweet https://t.co/oTxw8z6fja
