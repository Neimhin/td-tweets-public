Under Sinn F√©in, the Navan Rail project would start now (planning and design) &amp; continue, uninterrupted, to construction &amp; delivery. By allocating more funding to NDP, FF/FG/Greens could make same commitment...but haven't.
1618186824312303618	2023-01-25 09:59:38+00:00	@DublinCommuters @meathchronicle Strange. Aren't you supposed to advocate for ambition and delivery rather than making excuses for delays?! Sinn F√©in will do MORE. Specifically, in this round of the NDP - Navan Rail and the Western Rail Corridor. We've made that commitment publicly and repeatedly.

Unless that changes, 2031 is best case start date."
1618160881980047361	2023-01-25 08:16:32+00:00	Why 2036? Because this Govt. have failed to provide sufficient funding in the National Development Plan out to 2030. It's a simple as that.

1616090243366633472	2023-01-19 15:08:34+00:00	@EM_Creative @finnegan_barry Essential to start design &amp; planning now. Any delay will delay whole project. Per NTA &amp; Aecom whole project should take 8-10 years including up to 5 years construction - so 2031 to 2033 if we started today. 2036 and no guarantee of funding is not a win IMO. Need to keep pushing.
1616051932379897856	2023-01-19 12:36:20+00:00	@EM_Creative All this at a time of binding legal emissions reductions targets - and a ‚Ç¨5bn budget surplus! Important to note the Aecom report set out an 8 year schedule for the project in terms of planning and cost. https://t.co/EOCQOmjKR1

1616050331544322049	2023-01-19 12:29:58+00:00	@EM_Creative Incrementalism, Ed! We need radical reform in public and active transport but Govt is going little beyond business as usual. Take it as a given that there will be hurdles in planning and delivery (we can do better e.g. by resourcing the planning system) but we haven‚Äôt even hit
1616048368912068610	2023-01-19 12:22:10+00:00	These are Govt‚Äôs priorities for 22-30. There‚Äôs movement on every one of these NOW or imminent. To deliver beyond that requires extra commitment and funding. For our part, SF has committed to 2 additional projects - Navan Rail and Western Rail Corridor. https://t.co/U74RxtgG5s
1616047537810554880	2023-01-19 12:18:52+00:00	It‚Äôs important for activist groups to be able to cut through political bluster. This is a simple matter.
