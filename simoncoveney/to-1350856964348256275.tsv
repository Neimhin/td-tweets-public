The Protocol can work with cooperation and pragmatism, that’s our focus - the alternative, if we’re honest with people, is chaotic.
1357610309209456640	2021-02-05 08:41:35+00:00	Great to hear positive comment on NI Protocol. There are significant advantages for NI flowing from barrier free access to EU &amp; GB.
