A strong an united response from EU needed.  EU inaction or indecision will be taken as weakness by Belarus. @dfatirl https://t.co/WUwdcsTjSU

1392475872318328845	2021-05-12 13:44:53+00:00	Protection of civilians, particularly children, is of paramount importance. IHL must be respected. Thanks to humanitarian community who continue to deliver under these conditions. Now is the time for strong political engagement. We must act now.  @irishmissionun #SecurityCouncil
1392475870951006226	2021-05-12 13:44:53+00:00	The #SecurityCouncil must speak on this issue and condemn violence against civilians by all parties and call for an immediate ceasefire. People of the Gaza Strip cannot endure another war. Rockets from Gaza into Israel must stop.
1392475869424373760	2021-05-12 13:44:52+00:00	Ireland is at UN #SecurityCouncil now having called for an emergency meeting on escalating violence in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel. Thoughts are with Palestinians and Israelis who bear the brunt of this. Civilians on both sides deserve better.
