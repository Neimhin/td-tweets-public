1550757666745622528	2022-07-23 08:20:14+00:00	@ALLYPIP2 You make a fair point on goods staying in UK.  Last year EU recognised that goods from GB, staying in NI, should be treated very differently and require far fewer checks.  I advocated for that &amp; believe it can be the basis for an agreed compromise. But we need a partner in UK.
