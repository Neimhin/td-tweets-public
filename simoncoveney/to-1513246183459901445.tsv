1514820106429239298	2022-04-15 04:17:12+00:00	A residential area in #Bucha yesterday, 25mins from centre of #Kyiv. This is what #Russia’s war on #Ukraine looks like. #Ireland will do all we can to support #Ukraine and to end this aggression through tougher sanctions, accountability for Russian actions &amp; intensive diplomacy. https://t.co/sJCKvHtbUU
1513856060712435716	2022-04-12 12:26:25+00:00	What a fantastic group of people I’m privileged to work with at @dfatirl - their service at home and abroad to #Ireland through #Covid and multiple international challenges has been, and continues to be, inspiring. Great to kick off our 3 day conference this morning. 🇮🇪🇪🇺🇺🇳 https://t.co/FvgXFopA7j

1513530337770549254	2022-04-11 14:52:07+00:00	Very happy to meet today with Minister @nicupopescu . A good opportunity to voice Ireland’s support for Moldova’s European perspective and to discuss how we can support Moldova and the Moldovan community in Ireland. https://t.co/AM11OQjHDG
1513521502917963785	2022-04-11 14:17:00+00:00	Today at FAC I called on @EU_Commission to immediately release more than €200m of promised 2021 funding to Palestinian Authority that’s been blocked for months. Delay is impacting ordinary Palestinians &amp; contributing to increased instability. Strong support from other ministers. https://t.co/L2iWMeAJDo
1513510218642386951	2022-04-11 13:32:10+00:00	I strongly condemn this disgraceful, cowardly attack against a PSNI officer trying to help the community. There’s never a justification for violence like this. I urge anyone with information to share it with PSNI.  https://t.co/ztc6QGYSir
