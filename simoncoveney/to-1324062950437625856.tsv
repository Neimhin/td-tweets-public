1336462693457391623	2020-12-09 00:08:31+00:00	@eoinyk Eoin, WA is legally binding obligation in int. law. Protocol is part of it &amp; needs to be implemented regardless of whether a future relationship deal is agreed or not. Of course Protocol is more difficult without a trade deal. Today‚Äôs agreement is an important and positive step.

Makes sense, we are neighbours after all.

We must continue to prepare as a country for all outcomes. A deal remains doable but very difficult. Time is short.  Thank u @MichelBarnier for your calm and consistent approach. https://t.co/CjFasTtsmu
