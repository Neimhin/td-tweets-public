The point is that the law must apply evenly, to all, if reconciliation is to be possible in NI.  Victims &amp; families on all sides deserve truth &amp; protection of the law.

EU moved in a positive way this week, time for UKG to reciprocate. - Irish taoiseach urges No 10 to match EU generosity over NI protocol. https://t.co/QJxr6NpHyQ

1411387838470447109	2021-07-03 18:14:17+00:00	Taoiseach is spot on - “Britain should reciprocate goodwill shown by EU on protocol”  - implementing protocol is not about political manoeuvring or pressurising, it’s about implementing together what’s been agreed in a fair way &amp; giving people certainty.  https://t.co/dL2prYV1SB
