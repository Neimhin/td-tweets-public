We will do everything we can to support you through these restrictions. For now we are acting to save lives, reduce #Covid spread &amp; plan for a better December &amp; Christmas.
1318304353321705479	2020-10-19 21:33:45+00:00	Govt made necessary decisions tonight to protect people from #COVID19, but I know how difficult the consequences are for so many for the next 6 wks. That’s why we’ve increased financial supports &amp; protections. Please work with us &amp; together we can beat this virus! https://t.co/tMTSXfxBbA

1317865671817125894	2020-10-18 16:30:35+00:00	@BBCPolitics EU’s been consistent throughout #Brexit, working for a deal. LPF &amp; Fisheries were always going to be difficult issues to resolve.  It’s UK that’s moved away from commitments made a year ago &amp; now has unrealistic demands. Let’s get back to negotiation &amp; focus on getting deal done!

Budget sets aside enormous funding to protect livelihoods through a No-Trade-Deal Brexit, but we are still working for a deal. It can be achieved! 🇪🇺🇬🇧

1313126905713917954	2020-10-05 14:40:25+00:00	A lot of fear, anger &amp; worry today on #Covid &amp; right response for the country. We must not allow it turn to division. This is a pandemic, normal rules don’t apply. Let’s stick together. Govt will make decisions in best interests of public health, taking all advice into account.
1313053594942418949	2020-10-05 09:49:07+00:00	@SteveAikenUUP @BobbyMcDonagh1 Steve, when Unionist concerns aren’t mentioned in Irish media you’re unhappy, when balanced people like Bobby try to recognise unionist concerns you’re unhappy. Perhaps less twitter criticism &amp; more talking might help. I’m happy to talk at any point as I have been through Brexit.
