Make no mistake: this is a shocking murderous act of aggression against a sovereign peaceful state. EU and world needs to respond strongly.  @dfatirl
1496746324775079937	2022-02-24 07:18:26+00:00	Our thoughts &amp; prayers are with the innocent people of Ukraine, as families wake up to shocking Russian attacks. Russian leaders are lying to their own people to justify this illegal aggression.  We utterly condemn Russia for this act of unjustifiable war in the heart of Europe.
