1498025034803253254	2022-02-27 19:59:34+00:00	Tomorrow, @UN Security Council will discuss humanitarian situation in #Ukraine. Russia‚Äôs veto last week can not silence condemnation of Russian actions. We‚Äôll push for strong action at the UN General Assembly, where EU will vote in support of a robust resolution. @irishmissionun
1498024489346605056	2022-02-27 19:57:24+00:00	EU FAC tonight: ‚Ç¨500m EPF support for Ukraine Military.  Key Russian Banks out of  Swift. Russian Aircraft banned from EU Airspace.

1497836269132558339	2022-02-27 07:29:29+00:00	Shocking Russian attacks on Ukraine overnight. #Ireland will move to shut off Irish Airspace to all Russian Aircraft. We encourage other EU partners to do the same. We also support new wide-ranging sanctions to be agreed today at EU FAC &amp; new assistance package for #Ukraine. üá∫üá¶ https://t.co/tL7UriHsah

1497191786153795589	2022-02-25 12:48:32+00:00	Don‚Äôt bring Ireland into an argument trying to justify and unjustifiable war.  Ireland/U.K. are an example of how 2 countries, with a difficult past, found a way to shape and sustain a peace process, guaranteeing an absence of violence. @dfatirl https://t.co/dQlSfckRPs
1497150056394338304	2022-02-25 10:02:43+00:00	In Brussels for Emergency FAC to approve sanctions.  Images from Ukraine horrifying this morning. Murderous brutality of Russia‚Äôs war plain to see in heart of Europe.  Most powerful voice to stop this madness can come from Russian people, holding their leadership to account!
1496899917557739524	2022-02-24 17:28:46+00:00	@tconnellyRTE Stay safe Tony. Thank you for your important work.

Russian leaders are lying to their own people to justify this illegal aggression.  We utterly condemn Russia for this act of unjustifiable war in the heart of Europe.
1496742219079954432	2022-02-24 07:02:07+00:00	Russia has launched a full scale invasion of Ukraine. God help them. Rocket attacks &amp; explosions across the country.

Work to do, but there are landing zones that allow the protocol to be implemented in a way that responds positively to concerns raised in Northern Ireland.
