1242102316179828741	2020-03-23 14:54:03+00:00	Off to briefing with Taoiseach now. Will be asking when non essential work will be stopping, when the 40,000 people waiting for tests, will be tested, how many private beds they have brought into the Public Health Service and what is happening with extra PPE. #COVID19  @rtenews

1241423059036274688	2020-03-21 17:54:56+00:00	Funny neither ⁦@FineGael⁩ or ⁦@fiannafailparty⁩ were saying this on Thurs when ⁦@pb4p⁩ we’re the only ones who said it in the #Dail debate and proposed an amendment to give everyone a higher payment and they didn’t  support us. ⁦ https://t.co/wwrDsqtOV4
1241392146126704640	2020-03-21 15:52:06+00:00	In the Dail this week I said €203  #Covid_19 payment is unacceptably low &amp; proposed ALL get at least €305. Govt rejected our amendment. Yet, UK and many EU workers to get 70-80% of wages! Workers staying home are fighting #COVID19 &amp; must be supported. #payworkers2stayhome https://t.co/zuGCypWyBK

1240698018455674881	2020-03-19 17:53:53+00:00	Good that the government has conceded our proposed amendment that the draconian powers being established with this bill, will be time limited and can only be a extended  with a vote of the Oireachtas.
1240586498233323520	2020-03-19 10:30:44+00:00	Attending the #Dail business committee this morning.  Will say, while we must fully respect public health advice, it's imperative that democracy continues to function.  Amendments on emergency legislation must be voted on &amp; some functioning of Dáil and key cttees must continue.
1240038431100731394	2020-03-17 22:12:55+00:00	@RTE_PrimeTime Incredible!

Organise key parts of the Economy(Housing, Health,Public Transport etc) on a not-for-profit basis to eliminate the Boom-Bust cycle.
1225789074050600961	2020-02-07 14:31:03+00:00	@unicefireland @pb4p @StVincentsCork Incentivise farmers to be guardians of Nature &amp; to plant native tree species, not Sitka Spruce plantations. Expand Coillte afforestation programmes with less focus on commercial profit &amp; more on biodiversity. We stopped privatisation before &amp; will always keep it public.

1225784700695957504	2020-02-07 14:13:41+00:00	@unicefireland @pb4p @StVincentsCork No. Prohibition doesn’t work. It just drives things underground &amp; creates greater health threats. We need better public health education initiatives.
1225783739374088192	2020-02-07 14:09:52+00:00	@unicefireland @pb4p @StVincentsCork Provide proper youth services &amp; facilities 1st to give young people alternatives. Better counselling, mental health &amp; rehab services. Decriminalise drugs to take them out of criminal gang control.

1223601415635054593	2020-02-01 13:38:05+00:00	One of the issues that has been coming up on the doors regularly is the lack of affordable childcare places, I was given one minute to outline what we want to do in this field.

1223548710442930178	2020-02-01 10:08:39+00:00	Latest poll confirms what @pb4p said from start of campaign that majority want to #breakthecycle of FG/FF rule &amp; that a left government is possible. SF, Greens etc should now rule out coalition with FG/FF &amp; stick with the left to offer a real alternative #changeiscoming @rtenews https://t.co/Y935EgslCV

We continue to see many students priced out education. FG/FF gov invests more per horse than they do in higher education students.
