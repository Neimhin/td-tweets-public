In Consumer Act 2007, in the government has the power to control the maximum prices.   And yet they continue to do nothing and let the suffering to continue. https://t.co/BietVEJsk8
1501602487371014153	2022-03-09 16:55:06+00:00	Dereclict/vacant site levies have FAILED.   There are now €14.3 outstanding in vacant site charges. There are €7.9 million of derelict site levies. In 2020 €378,000 out of €5.4 MILLION was collected in levies.   These could be homes. https://t.co/IY7FfM4tqj
1501552131328851971	2022-03-09 13:35:00+00:00	With the war in Ukraine, the rate of inflation is due to rise even further.   Public sector workers are locked into 1% pay increases per year.   Their employer, the government, is effectively cutting their pay. https://t.co/EIzkvpykIQ

1499308620269461507	2022-03-03 09:00:05+00:00	The Amnesty report is a stark indictment of Israel.   Unequivocally accusing it of apartheid, crimes against humanity.   It doesn’t get any clearer than this. Yet the Irish government wants to be “careful” in its language. https://t.co/ssH2pb2KUn
1499082158639616002	2022-03-02 18:00:12+00:00	Solidarity to the ground staff of Aer Lingus who voted against taking a pay freeze by 85% FOR THE SECOND TIME!  Worth noting that the company that owns Aer Lingus and British Airways gave its BA staff a 10% pay increase. So why not the same for its AL staff? https://t.co/l7XjWPoJGW
1499052099874828289	2022-03-02 16:00:46+00:00	Shocking double standards by Míchael Martin.

1484070800202375168	2022-01-20 07:50:26+00:00	This confirms my long-held and worst suspicion that Government via the LDA wants to get rid of traditional Council housing, where rent based on income, and replace it with higher rents based on market costs. @pb4p will resist this retrograde and foolish approach @TommyMeskill https://t.co/NzwFd74YoT
1483863613454569477	2022-01-19 18:07:08+00:00	Hugely ironic. The super rich appealing to world leaders to pay higher taxes, and yet the Irish gov still refuses to introduce a wealth tax! Even billionaires say they don't pay enough tax! https://t.co/5Eb7rK4ooE

ACTS gives many people across South Dublin freedom to travel. The government must act quickly to provide buses and funding to keep ACTS going. https://t.co/eLk3ai3E8D

And at the same time homes are totally unaffordable to buy or rent for young workers, fewer &amp; fewer are eligible for social housing because Gov refuse to raise income thresholds for years. So there’s no options! https://t.co/pP9YuHgNzM
1480551975804669957	2022-01-10 14:47:53+00:00	Mandatory vaccines would be ethically wrong &amp; counter-productive. @pb4p strongly support vaccination but making it mandatory will undermine trust in public health policy. Gov distracting from failure to resource health service,give free antigen &amp; hypocrisy on vaccine IP &amp; patents
1480545605810364421	2022-01-10 14:22:34+00:00	Mandatory vaccine is ethically wrong, unnecessary and counter productive. @pb4p supports the vaccination programme but making it mandatory is the wrong move and gov would be better ensuring EU suspends patents to ensure cheap supply of vaccine globally.
1473365839676157956	2021-12-21 18:52:44+00:00	I’m getting a flood of messages from musicians &amp; taxi drivers who are getting much lower PUP payments than they got in March 2020 even though their work has collapsed and they are in dire straits facing into Xmas.

The gov is facilitating this by continuing to allow for-profit housing to be built like the Co-Living complex in Eblana Avenue rather than building public and truly affordable housing. https://t.co/RFbZliJvf6

1465686469071228931	2021-11-30 14:17:40+00:00	It is quite frankly a shocking and immoral position for the Irish government and the EU to take where they are preventing the quickest way of securing enough vaccine to inoculate the world against this disease.
1465686465891950593	2021-11-30 14:17:39+00:00	The EU’s blocking of the waiving of intellectual property rights on COVID vaccinations was an act that was sabotaging efforts to deal with the pandemic and perpetuating the conditions where further variants were likely to develop. https://t.co/AQlw4pi42F
