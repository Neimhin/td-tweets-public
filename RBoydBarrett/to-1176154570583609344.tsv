The govt and HSE must provide the needed funds to prevent a disastrous closure for dementia sufferers, their families and the wonderful staff @cian_mccormack https://t.co/jhVskSpqAa
1192024989899403264	2019-11-06 10:24:39+00:00	Yesterday the Dail was suspended after Fine Gael ceann  comhairle blocked us, completely undemocraticicaly from moving a motion to discuss their blocking of opposition bills such as the anti eviction bill, climate emergency bill, and the access to medicinal cannabis bill https://t.co/9C6EO53QK4
1192023508714426370	2019-11-06 10:18:45+00:00	Closure of St Joseph’s Shankill Dementia Care home would be a total disaster for dementia sufferers &amp; families in our area and can’t be allowed to happen -Govt must immediately commit needed funds @cian_mccormack https://t.co/jhVskSpqAa

1189452750700122112	2019-10-30 08:03:29+00:00	Another terrible decision by @FineGael to add to their endless litany of housing policy failures. SHD’s are a licence for developers to by-pass proper planning &amp; make big profits but do nothing to deliver the affordable &amp; public housing we need. @rtenews @NewstalkFM @pb4p https://t.co/pELvWXML6D
1186342041422389256	2019-10-21 18:02:38+00:00	#TheNorthIsNow. Great day today for choice and equality for all the campaigners for rights for women and LGBT+ community north and south of border. #repealedThe8th #Decriminalised https://t.co/W3I3ZYD10g

1185902496146972672	2019-10-20 12:56:02+00:00	LDA is a vehicle to privatise public building land by the back-door &amp; financialize the construction of social &amp; affordable housing. Along with SHD’s its more of @FineGael ‘s disastrous, pro-developer/speculator policy that created the housing crisis in the first place @rtenews https://t.co/UImySHei1L
1185074884143210496	2019-10-18 06:07:24+00:00	This is so true-great to see British local authorities moving in this direction. We need waste and water brought back into councils, we need public projects like the Dún Laoghaire Baths built by council workers. more jobs, better value and more control. @DLRForsa @forsa_union_ie https://t.co/jzJ2Q9uTcG
1184428207874990080	2019-10-16 11:17:45+00:00	Absolute scandal, disability activists Bernard Mulvany &amp; Sean O Kelly highlighting constant breakdown of lifts at Dart stations affecting wheelchair users were asked to leave Connolly station today. 10 lifts out at weekend, Seapoint out for months! @rtenews @NewstalkFM https://t.co/VFUPZs0dip

1181616439171653635	2019-10-08 17:04:47+00:00	#Budget2020 cut €25m from Local Gov Fund. Despite gov promises about #propertytax there is less money for local services. How will council’s retrofit houses and upgrade ber rating on libraries, town halls etc? Eco Hypocrisy from @FineGael? @rtenews @IrishTimes @irishexaminer

1180214779492913152	2019-10-04 20:15:05+00:00	Thanks to @MarkRuffalo for supporting our battle against importation of fracked gas in Ireland. https://t.co/ooVJZuxoT9
1179393359590371331	2019-10-02 13:51:03+00:00	Against stubborn resistance, @pb4p myself &amp; @bridsmithTD have forced Gov to concede a debate on Shannon LNG terminal to import US fracked gas, which govt disgracefully approved without any discussion in #Dail. Debate will take place at 1.15pm tomorrow #KeepItInTheGround
1178246058570371073	2019-09-29 09:52:05+00:00	So fast track scheme 4 housing is just what @pb4p has been saying.A gift for developers, a bypassing of democracy &amp; not delivering the promised homes or construction jobs. Also exposes cosy relationship between developers and @HousingPress. No wonder Minister not available! https://t.co/oLzuK8vtom
1177939050336047104	2019-09-28 13:32:09+00:00	Good turnout @MarchForChoice after great victory of #repealedThe8th. We need to ensure hassle free access to abortion services across the whole island. #thenorthisnow https://t.co/LECXpnXNmj
1176923398745874437	2019-09-25 18:16:19+00:00	Well said Mark! @LeoVaradkar says he wants action on climate crisis but backs new terminal to import fracked gas from US &amp; blocks @pb4p bills to ban further oil &amp; gas exploration &amp; stop LNG terminal. Irish gov speaking out both sides of its mouth on climate @rtenews @MarkRuffalo https://t.co/ECdFziUWX0
1176915584983941125	2019-09-25 17:45:16+00:00	Finally @48NeverCameHome campaign has got the new inquest they have been calling for for years. Huge respect for all these campaigners and honeybee gave up in their fight for justice. https://t.co/nCbshx8OLY
1176395019000958977	2019-09-24 07:16:43+00:00	On @BreakfastNT re @LeoVaradkar’s announcement re stopping exploration for oil. Disingenuous at its best, pretending he is doing something for #planet when gov will continue to explore for gas &amp; import LNG. As @GretaThunberg says “how dare they!” #ClimateAction #KeepItInTheGround
1176154570583609344	2019-09-23 15:21:16+00:00	@LeoVaradkar comments at UN have no credibility when his govt have done everything to block @pb4p climate emergency measures bill which seeks to ban further fossil fuel exploration &amp; when FG supporting Shannon LNG terminal to import fracked US gas. Very disingenuous. https://t.co/RvjKDfcMgd
