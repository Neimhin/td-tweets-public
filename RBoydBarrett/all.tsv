More cuts coming down the line next week. This payment needs to be kept until jobs and income are restored. Will be raising this with @LeoVaradkar shortly
1280614605912408065	2020-07-07 21:28:09+00:00	110k people saw incomes slashed today with govt cuts in PUP payment-many arts, ents, music workers &amp; taxi drivers. Perversely, they’re punished for being on low &amp; precarious incomes when #COVID19 broke out. We should demand payments remain til their livelihoods recover. @pb4p
1280771876445458432	2020-07-08 07:53:05+00:00	Rather than cutting the income supports for taxi drivers, arts workers and others, the Government should maintain these payments as subsidies for those whose employment and income opportunities have been devastated through no fault of their own  https://t.co/y2UY812WyB

1283298716426829824	2020-07-15 07:13:51+00:00	The idea it makes no difference if Irish gov appeals #appletax ruling is nonsense. If gov stopped supporting #Apple ‘s appeal against paying €13 billion tax, it would hugely weaken Apple’s defence. It’s “economic treason” for gov to support #Apple’s efforts to avoid tax @pb4p
1283332685235093505	2020-07-15 09:28:49+00:00	EU court decision incomprehensible. #Apple was clearly using shell companies tax resident nowhere to avoid billions in tax on sales made through companies registered in Ireland.The Irish gov sided with a tax dodging corporation to rob us of €13 billion we desperately need. Shame

1283773221142171655	2020-07-16 14:39:21+00:00	The government should give certainty and security to tenants by giving a clear commitment that no evictions will take place as long as  #COVID19 health pandemic persists.

1287378481404432384	2020-07-26 13:25:22+00:00	@political_dub @pb4p A) the advice on DFA is contradictory B) why should penalties for acting contrary to official travel advice be limited to people who already suffered through no fault of their own the loss of their job because of #COVIDー19 ?
1287391986337669121	2020-07-26 14:19:02+00:00	@political_dub @pb4p Because it refers to the “general advisory” in black bold at the top of the page, not the exemption further down.

Also Official DFA website says explicitly the general advice on non-essential travel doesnt apply to so-called green list, so different standard being applied to PUP recipients!

1287483972038078469	2020-07-26 20:24:33+00:00	@conorgalvin @pb4p @rtenews Agree but restrictions must apply to all or to none. Restrictions are meaningless if they only apply to those on covid payment and it gets even worse when DFA says explicitly that non-essential restriction doesnt apply to some countries but gov apply it to all PUP recipients

1287490066152067074	2020-07-26 20:48:46+00:00	@mailsanchu @pb4p @rtenews My point is simple, if non-essential travel is not allowed, it should be stopped for all not just those on PUP payments. Also gov should not have Advice on their website saying it’s ok to holiday to some countries but penalise one group for following that advice but not others.

Schools re-opening 3. Tracking &amp; tracing regime 4. ICU &amp; health system capacity in event of further surges to name but a few really urgent issues that cannot wait
1297500206016208896	2020-08-23 11:45:30+00:00	A belated apology forced on Phil Hogan by public outrage is just not good enough. There must be consequences for such a flagrant breach of public health guidelines. Hogan is Ireland’s rep on the most powerful EU body. He must resign or fight against #COVID19 is totally undermined https://t.co/8zFPl6AwS5
1297563090658250753	2020-08-23 15:55:23+00:00	Why must #philhogan &amp; #SeamusWoulfe resign?Cos for weeks gov blamed young people/parties for #COVID19 rising. They plan law for Gardaí to enter homes over parties.But former AG who wrote covid laws &amp; EU commissioner go to party of 81 people &amp; no sanction! #onelaw4them is not on! https://t.co/jFGgWba36G
1298256523878047753	2020-08-25 13:50:50+00:00	Very annoyed to hear from #Dail business cte,Gov only plan minimal sitting of Dail next week to install Ag Minister &amp; item on “responses” to #COVID19. This is unacceptable. We need full Dail sitting with Q’s to Ed Min on schools,Health Min on Covid &amp; Taoiseach on #golfgate @pb4p

1298274461599186950	2020-08-25 15:02:07+00:00	Gov forced into early return of #Dail. But just heard they want short sitting only to install new Minister &amp; item on #covid19. We demand full sittings with Q’s to Taoiseach on #golfgate scandal, Ed Min on schools &amp; Health Min on #covid19. We must have accountability ⁦@pb4p⁩ https://t.co/sXpH7spluh

It is the gov who ignored public health advice two weeks ago and allowed infection to multiply. Will they be fined for ignoring public health advice?

Yet Dublin City centre was deserted last night, a Thursday night when town would usually be buzzing- and this BEFORE fines are introduced ie voluntarily people follow advice, when given.

They do everything to protect interests of tax dodging big corporations, yet they oppose @pb4p #Dail motion calling for a deferral of carbon tax hikes to prevent fuel poverty and winter deaths, after recent energy price hikes!
1445764271971835917	2021-10-06 14:53:58+00:00	The burden of #ClimateChange should not be carried on the shoulders of ordinary people. A carbon tax should be applied to big polluters: big tech, agri-food corporations. Not the individual. https://t.co/dLz8ng6FBr

I hope he’s defeated by the Ukrainian resistance and by Russians horrified by his murderous invasion of Ukraine. However, Zelensky discredits the Ukrainian cause by allying with and platforming nazi elements, however small.

1574812732163084292	2022-09-27 17:26:28+00:00	The gov has put a lot of spin on #Budget2023, but the reality is that the super-wealthy in this country, the vulture funds et al won't pay a cent more tax after the budget.

1575116973356244993	2022-09-28 13:35:25+00:00	One of the perverse consequences of last night's #Budget2023 is with the new tax bands, people who will see a marginal increase in their income will be thrown off the housing list.

1600461779733192704	2022-12-07 12:06:38+00:00	🤯 The government has underspent on housing by €700 million while we are in the grips of a housing crisis - not even one house was built in the first six months of 2022 by the four Dublin local authorities. Unacceptable! #housingcrisis https://t.co/uqPialSC0N

1602236594421133312	2022-12-12 09:39:06+00:00	Minister @DarraghOBrienTD claimed on @morningireland that @pb4p isn’t putting forward positive proposals on the #HousingCrisis. This is nonsense.Our Dail motion specifically sets out proposals on rents, stopping evictions,homelessness &amp; vacant properties that he refuses to adopt.
1602680722908749824	2022-12-13 15:03:55+00:00	Massive victory for people power today. After 17 years of campaigning by ordinary people and a grassroots movement, Dún Laoghaire Baths is finally open. Next step is to make sure we get our pool! https://t.co/BpbNgf0OG7
