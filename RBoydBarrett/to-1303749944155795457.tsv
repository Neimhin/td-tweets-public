Then he said he was being witch-hunted because he was held to account for that but insists he must still judge others in the highest court in the land.

1319641385855832070	2020-10-23 14:06:38+00:00	@garrethmcdaid @nordyteacher I think you forget, we had almost eliminated community &amp; household transmission in June, through the efforts of the public. If the right message comes from the top people have shown they will respond without coercion. It was the gov who ignored public health advice 2 weeks ago
1319625063700848645	2020-10-23 13:01:47+00:00	@garrethmcdaid @nordyteacher No one wants lock-down - it’s grim and terrible. Yet Dublin City centre was deserted last night, a Thursday night when town would usually be buzzing- and this BEFORE fines are introduced ie voluntarily people follow advice, when given. That would have happened two weeks ago also
1319621474873954304	2020-10-23 12:47:31+00:00	@nordyteacher @garrethmcdaid We firmly believe the public will and have followed public health advice if they are supported and persuaded of the rationale. It is the gov who ignored public health advice two weeks ago and allowed infection to multiply. Will they be fined for ignoring public health advice?
1319615779038482432	2020-10-23 12:24:53+00:00	gov is bringing in laws to fine us for not obeying public health advice - they want to blame us for the rise in cases. Real problem is the mess they are making of the whole thing - evidenced by the collapse in tracing last weekend and testing this weekend. https://t.co/cebh4HkfzN
1319607366363512833	2020-10-23 11:51:27+00:00	Some of “the opposition” are not saying this, @pb4p oppose the legislation as it blames public behaviour rather than failure of Gov strategy &amp; policy for rising #COVID19 infection rates. Eg Failure to follow public health advice, staff &amp; resource test &amp; trace etc  @sandra_hurley https://t.co/DswCqoS1z8
1319397555411865601	2020-10-22 21:57:45+00:00	Utterly, shameful today, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael &amp; worst of all Greens, ram through bill to put 30 year seal on archive from Mother &amp; Baby commission burying the shameful record of church &amp; states cruel treatment of thousands who suffered in those institutions @pb4p #Stand4Truth https://t.co/ET5Hwte5nO

Whereas zero COVID gives hope for a different future. @pb4p #ZeroCovid
1318287670272032769	2020-10-19 20:27:27+00:00	The Govt are endangering the social solidarity needed for the coming weeks of Level 5 by not fully restoring PUP &amp; failing to restore eviction ban &amp; mortgage break.

1316885511185772545	2020-10-15 23:35:47+00:00	There must be ‘social bubbles’ to protect mental health &amp; well being of those living alone with new restrictions or it will discredit public health effort &amp; an open debate on #COVID__19 strategy &amp; health measures, to give clarity &amp; hope not endless confusion &amp; uncertainty
1316477377455755264	2020-10-14 20:34:00+00:00	Govt announcement on no visits to  homes, a BIG mistake - will make no sense to people!

1316388383057469442	2020-10-14 14:40:22+00:00	This is outrageous. If we are going to get on top of this virus we need a focussed, professional and robust tracking system. Hard to believe that @HSELive recruiting them on zero hour contracts! https://t.co/ryVrRcxza4

1313394293147607040	2020-10-06 08:22:55+00:00	@JodyWannKenobi @pb4p @morningireland If Public health correct and they have provided evidence, the disease now escalating generally &amp; in older population &amp; nursing homes, we’ll be forced to increase restrictions anyway in weeks. Better to move now to crush it: that way less human,economic &amp; social damage in long run
1313381588231745536	2020-10-06 07:32:26+00:00	As @pb4p said yesterday Gov taking a “dangerous gamble” with what the lives of the vulnerable by ignoring public health advice. It’s clear from Stephen Donnelly on @morningireland they have no plan to drive virus back, so they are delaying inevitable &amp; prolonging the agony @pb4p

1311762580923392004	2020-10-01 20:19:05+00:00	Susan Denham decision about Seamus #Woulfe will seriously undermine credibility of public health restrictions to deal with #COVID19 .Young people,families berated for social gatherings in a pandemic but AG who oversaw emergency covid legislation- no consequences! @pb4p @rtenews https://t.co/jARUHYSw9C
1311629135886856193	2020-10-01 11:28:49+00:00	The Minister for Culture MUST provide a proper and coherent roadmap for those tens of thousands workers who work in the arts and entertainment industries. There is no plan, and these workers are left high and dry.  https://t.co/tWVNnBmVBf via @YouTube
1311214452503703552	2020-09-30 08:01:01+00:00	This is not good enough. CMO/NPET were supposed to come in separately, so they could be properly questioned. This format with Min Donnelly cuts in half time available to question both. We need in depth discussion on #COVID19 strategy @MaryERegan @rtenews @NewstalkFM @pb4p https://t.co/jGIrleo27D
1310920595077505026	2020-09-29 12:33:20+00:00	It’s just shocking that for the second week in a row the CMO and NPHET have refused to come in to the #COVID19 committee. What is going on? Where is the accountability and transparency. @pb4p https://t.co/TAilqh6Yss
1309548766505172992	2020-09-25 17:42:10+00:00	@SimonHarrisTD announcement that all 3rd level Ed will be on-line in coming weeks because of #COVIDー19 is even more reason why Gov must waive all student registration fees this year. Fees are not justified when student experience so diminished @rtenews @VirginMediaNews @pb4p
1308644343490715649	2020-09-23 05:48:19+00:00	Mr Boyd Barrett claimed Mr Donnelly said he was not coming in to the committee because “the new restrictions are not his” but were the responsibility of the whole of Government. https://t.co/wBymTpkCqm
1308014054393380864	2020-09-21 12:03:46+00:00	The cut of the pandemic unemployment payment is grossly unfair to people, who through no fault of their own, have lost work or income. At the same time government is signing big cheques to very profitable large companies. Where is the fairness in that? https://t.co/yxTbKOpHPR
1307298963352158208	2020-09-19 12:42:15+00:00	@Camilla_Fitzs @pb4p Agree completely Camilla

1307297596675850240	2020-09-19 12:36:50+00:00	@muzzahraif @pb4p In my view, it is not helpful if we don’t urgently address the issues I mentioned - in fact unless we address them very quickly, there is a real danger the public health effort will fail and lose public credibility
1307294002992099328	2020-09-19 12:22:33+00:00	New restrictions sadly needed but reflect failed and incoherent #COVID__19 strategy.Failure to properly resource &amp; staff health service, ICU, test &amp; trace regime, address meat plant &amp; workplace breaches, reduce class sizes &amp; now undermining social solidarity by cutting PUP @pb4p https://t.co/1OK3e7ATHZ

1306334637338374145	2020-09-16 20:50:22+00:00	With alarming spike in #COVID19 solidarity needed more than ever to defeat virus. Plan PUP cut is the opposite &amp; will dangerously undermine public health effort.Yet it’s not being debated. Did no one grasp meaning of taxi protest or dire plight of events workers? @pb4p  @rtenews
1306329089415016448	2020-09-16 20:28:19+00:00	With infections rising &amp; more #COVID19 restrictions looming,  Gov cut to PUP tomorrow is cruelly unfair. People who CAN’T return to work or earn a living income because of health measures are being punished, throwing “all in it together” principle out the window! Dangerous @pb4p
1306212911963090944	2020-09-16 12:46:41+00:00	The Live Entertainment &amp; Event sector is in 100% shutdown. If we ever want to get back to gigs, shows, festivals &amp; events we love so much, then we must support these workers.  #ThisIsWhoWeAre  Full vid on Facebook https://t.co/hEVWIPj5MX

1305145373024047104	2020-09-13 14:04:40+00:00	Good to see @cooper_m raise plight of taxis. I’ve been raising the drivers’ demands with gov for months. If we are “all in it together” Gov should show them respect &amp; give them an income subsidy &amp; grants. @pb4p fully support taxi driver protest on Tues &amp; will raise again in #Dail https://t.co/beTlEXqcR3
1304766620431273986	2020-09-12 12:59:38+00:00	The passing of an absolute legend! Terribly sad but the music will live always. https://t.co/WYQipzx4eO

1303965040488394752	2020-09-10 07:54:26+00:00	@langsdorfm @SimonHarrisTD @pb4p TDs regularly speak in Dáil to defend the rights of people with disabilities and carers. We have worked with campaign groups Access for All &amp;Kids begins the cuts. I will be speaking today on the issue highlighting the need for day care services to be reopened ASAP
1303749944155795457	2020-09-09 17:39:43+00:00	Giving Donnelly and his gov the power to make contradictory health guidelines that make no sense into criminal offences is a big mistake.  This is too much power for a gov whose #COVID strategy is a mess.
