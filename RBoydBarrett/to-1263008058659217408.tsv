Interesting how fast the state reacts to stop workers fighting for their rights, not so quick to stop companies abusing workers @pb4p

Fair play to them! 150 days on &amp; a totally insulting “offer” from the liquidators - this is how to respond. @pb4p supports this action fully. @ingridmileyRTE  @morningireland @NewstalkFM
1301898082095960072	2020-09-04 15:01:05+00:00	It’s obviously up to the heroic #debenhams workers who have waged such an inspiring fight to decide on this but I really doubt they will accept €1million between 1000 workers for decades of loyal service. They deserve so much more and will have @pb4p support if they fight on. https://t.co/3QaSRAgIPE

What they should do is change PUP to an income subsidy for taxi drivers and arts, music workers while available is hugely reduced
1288734193338515457	2020-07-30 07:12:29+00:00	Much bigger issue though is that thousands of musicians, arts &amp; ents workers &amp; taxi drivers seeing PUP cut off or cut down, whipped back to work with “actively seeking work” provision when no or little work exists.

1287490066152067074	2020-07-26 20:48:46+00:00	@mailsanchu @pb4p @rtenews My point is simple, if non-essential travel is not allowed, it should be stopped for all not just those on PUP payments. Also gov should not have Advice on their website saying it’s ok to holiday to some countries but penalise one group for following that advice but not others.
1287487401066221568	2020-07-26 20:38:11+00:00	@conorgalvin @pb4p @rtenews Honestly Conor I agree but you can’t say we’ll penalise some for not staying in Ireland but won’t penalise the rest-it’s all or nothing, if we’re all in it together,otherwise the legitimacy of public health advice falls apart.This action will undermine  the public health effort.
1287483972038078469	2020-07-26 20:24:33+00:00	@conorgalvin @pb4p @rtenews Agree but restrictions must apply to all or to none. Restrictions are meaningless if they only apply to those on covid payment and it gets even worse when DFA says explicitly that non-essential restriction doesnt apply to some countries but gov apply it to all PUP recipients
1287476000234836034	2020-07-26 19:52:53+00:00	@mailsanchu @pb4p @rtenews I thought we were all in it together. You think it’s ok that some people penalised for non-essential travel but others are not? Seriously?
1287475568041222145	2020-07-26 19:51:10+00:00	@conorgalvin @pb4p @rtenews Sure but travel restrictions should apply to everyone not just those who lost jobs cos of #COVIDー19 . Also Official DFA website says explicitly the general advice on non-essential travel doesnt apply to so-called green list, so different standard being applied to PUP recipients!
1287472153298898951	2020-07-26 19:37:36+00:00	This is truly grotesque! People who through no fault of their own lost their job because of #COVIDー19 are singled out for financial penalty for going on holidays. Travel restrictions are either for everyone or for no-one.

1287391986337669121	2020-07-26 14:19:02+00:00	@political_dub @pb4p Because it refers to the “general advisory” in black bold at the top of the page, not the exemption further down.
1287378481404432384	2020-07-26 13:25:22+00:00	@political_dub @pb4p A) the advice on DFA is contradictory B) why should penalties for acting contrary to official travel advice be limited to people who already suffered through no fault of their own the loss of their job because of #COVIDー19 ?
1287369091762839553	2020-07-26 12:48:04+00:00	This is grotesque!
