1458058505643077637	2021-11-09 13:06:51+00:00	Great news! Our campaign to stop Coillte selling off 39 acres in Enniskerry has scored a victory! Coillte called me this morning confirming that the sale was at an advanced stage, but following our intervention in Dail and Council and public outcry, they’ve abandoned the sale! https://t.co/OtF9UCYyMx

1457802503739695106	2021-11-08 20:09:36+00:00	Well done @MelisaHalpin and DLR councillors. We must keep pressure on to ensure that this forest and public amenity is not sold off. @pb4p https://t.co/og6JkykhXj
1456688260537896969	2021-11-05 18:21:59+00:00	Coillte yday confirmed to me that they are selling off 39acres of public forest near Enniskerry for a paultry 250,000. This is a scandal. This is a public forest with a right of way, bronze age cooking pits and is part of our natural heritage. This privatisation must be stopped. https://t.co/KgqrolfI0O

Apologies if the office didn’t get back we are just overrun with so many people in housing trouble

1455923127125487617	2021-11-03 15:41:37+00:00	5 times more forests are cut down than planted nationally. Shockingly, near Enniskerry, Coillte, a state company, is selling off 39 acres of public forest. Privatisation of public forests needs to be stopped. https://t.co/R2P7al0Em7
1455860110618775555	2021-11-03 11:31:13+00:00	@Carolin88582793 @DublinBayN_PBP @INMO_IRL Great to meet you too Caroline. Well done yesterday and keep it up. Student nurse &amp; midwife power will win through in the end!
1455858256899891205	2021-11-03 11:23:51+00:00	The COVID Pandemic highlighted how much our health service relies on student nurses and midwives to function. The bursary is just not adequate. €100 does little against the rising cost of living. Just insulting. https://t.co/juVgBeu0tm
1455609965608116230	2021-11-02 18:57:14+00:00	I put it to the Tánaiste that if we want a functioning health service in the future, we need to support and respect student nurses and midwives. The cost of living coupled with the tragic amount they are paid will force them abroad #PayStudentNursesandMidwives https://t.co/j4QdXERqeA
1455563782856581126	2021-11-02 15:53:43+00:00	delighted to stand with student nurses&amp;midwives today. nearly a year after we first brought the question of paying these students for their work to the  #Dáil, gov still has not acted on the recommendations. https://t.co/MpRh07s82b
1455559642298322947	2021-11-02 15:37:16+00:00	Great getting to talk to Caroline at @INMO_IRL's protest today outside the Dáil. Outrageous that after all they have done during COVID that still are not paid for all the work they do.

1455177131718234113	2021-11-01 14:17:18+00:00	There were empty promises from the government but they have done nothing of substance.  We desperately need to recruit and retain nurses, midwives and other health workers in our public health service, and that means we must treat them properly.  #PayStudentNursesandMidwives 2/2
1455177127570116613	2021-11-01 14:17:17+00:00	INMO have organised a protest outside the Dáil on Tuesday at 1PM over the failure of the gov to pay student nurses and midwives for their work while on placement.   @pb4p brought a motion on this issue to the Dáil last year.  1/2 https://t.co/rgYYl08OIl

1453821196965978113	2021-10-28 20:29:18+00:00	Today marks the 9th anniversary of the death of Savita Halappanavar.  It is an outrage that the Catholic Church, whose control has caused so much anguish, may still have a role in the NMH.  The NMH is a healthcare provider and it must be secular. #MakeNMHOurs https://t.co/UG39ISDQVT
1453400148118228998	2021-10-27 16:36:12+00:00	This is really disgraceful.

1451541537075175427	2021-10-22 13:30:45+00:00	For all the government’s talk on climate change, they stopped taking applications for taxi drivers to switch to electric vehicles.  €9m of grant funds made available to taxi drivers have not been spent. https://t.co/hKJNsZVzrV
1451527368544333829	2021-10-22 12:34:27+00:00	The @greenparty_ie came into gov on the promise of saving the planet from climate change.   And yet, in #Budget2022, afforestation, a vital part in reducing our carbon footprint, will receive less funding than 2021   Absolutely outrageous neglect. https://t.co/Ycw0yFOmTi
1451076756912447495	2021-10-21 06:43:53+00:00	I raised the issue of two Palestinian hunger strikers who have gone almost 100 days without food with the Taoiseach yesterday.   It is an insult to the memory of the Holocaust to equate defending the rights of Palestinians with anti-Semitism. https://t.co/mwmNfYZY7m
1450852132215791621	2021-10-20 15:51:18+00:00	It really is beggar's belief that the government has once again extended the Strategic Housing Development (SHDs) legislation.   This has nothing too do with solving the housing crisis and all to do with lining the pockets of developers. https://t.co/6K2Ktr1qwF
1450536024552132613	2021-10-19 18:55:12+00:00	I asked An Taoiseach today why the government continues to allow NAMA to contribute to the housing crisis through leaving homes vacant or selling them off to vulture funds rather than provide public and genuinely affordable housing. https://t.co/FwCoJSpUy4
1450453152902361094	2021-10-19 13:25:54+00:00	Despite everything our arts and entertainment workers have been through the past 18months, it's shocking that there wasn't a single extra penny allocated for them in #budget2022 https://t.co/LItU5lT9EU
1450402245305118720	2021-10-19 10:03:37+00:00	Once again, abolishing Strategic Housing Developments has been long-fingered. This legislation that allow developers to bypass local democracy and line their pockets needs to be repealed immediately - no more delays! https://t.co/UI7VlKLxqE via @businessposthq
1450221416675225607	2021-10-18 22:05:04+00:00	Well done @MelisaHalpin. Vital that the profit of developers does not come before the protection of this amenity and heritage site. Fair play to all those in the area who have fought the proposed inappropriate development for the last years. @pb4p https://t.co/YTVRW4FWPJ
1450124089465712642	2021-10-18 15:38:19+00:00	For all the government talk on climate action, they actually cut funding for public transport in #Budget2022.  If they want people out of cars we need more buses and we need to dramatically reduces or abolish fares to make public transport more attractive. https://t.co/CuusRZsLTU
1449737088312696833	2021-10-17 14:00:31+00:00	@happewilhelm Not as yet. I wrote to Leo Varadkar shortly after the Dail exchange, so we shall see. I hope he does what he said, so hopefully I’ll hear something this week but of course, these two families just shouldn’t be in this situation in the first place
1448977826653290504	2021-10-15 11:43:29+00:00	I raised to the Tánaiste the shocking cases of two families who have been in homeless accommodation with their children for 4 and 6 years.  This can't go on. The government has to look after people's housing needs instead of vulture funds. https://t.co/5bNpVzXdPP
1448661701037944840	2021-10-14 14:47:19+00:00	In the #Budget2022's small print you will find that 1500 of the wealthiest people in Ireland will be receiving a SARP tax break of 38.2 million euro.  Meanwhile the Mental Health Budget only got an additional 36 million.  Who is more important to this government? https://t.co/iAfBsJURnO

1448599724165054466	2021-10-14 10:41:02+00:00	Sally Rooney should be commended for supporting the BDS campaign against the apartheid regime in Israel. As someone who lived in Israel/ Palestine for a year, there is no doubt it is an apartheid regime. We must test Israel as apartheid South Africa was treated. @TodaywithClaire
1448322637168529409	2021-10-13 16:19:59+00:00	We need to continue to build these housing movements: students, pensioners, victims of #mica, low-income workers, Travelers, migrants, etc, all need accommodation. We must have a winter of Housing Discontent, and continue to hold the political establishment's feet to the fire.
1448322631749574657	2021-10-13 16:19:58+00:00	It was great to stand with student's unions from across Dublin today to protest the abysmal state of the housing crises for students and to call out the flippant remarks made by Owen Keegan regarding the current crisis faced by student renters. https://t.co/fyy0Qz66Kw
1448300329594929159	2021-10-13 14:51:21+00:00	Nothing at all for renters in the #budget. Any increases to take home pay, social welfare or pension will be more than wiped out by carbon tax, energy prices, increase in LPT etc https://t.co/y698Q2nOaW

1447965687851491330	2021-10-12 16:41:36+00:00	There is nothing in #Budget22 to deal with the extortionate increase in rents, or the pitifully low delivery of public and affordable housing. It's shockingly inadequate and fails to meet challenges facing the majority of people. #Budget2022 will hurt the least well off the most. https://t.co/U8u8ZX6NEE
1447909238802722817	2021-10-12 12:57:18+00:00	Capital housing allocation to build public &amp; affordable housing in budget book of estimates is €2.2 billion not the €4 billion we kept hearing about in recent weeks. When figure is further broken down we’ll discover it’s even less as this heading covers many  areas #Budget2022 https://t.co/wltpr4eecE
1447905041994723329	2021-10-12 12:40:37+00:00	Income increase for average worker on 30k is a pathetic 0.5 % for someone on 40k 0.45% - this against cost of living rising by 3.7% per year, energy price hikes, rents rocketing and carbon taxes going up. Working people will be poorer at the end of the year! @pb4p #Budget2022 https://t.co/fdbYn2UI91
1447902494777094146	2021-10-12 12:30:30+00:00	Zoned land levy a total joke, with 2 or 3 year lead in before it’s imposed on land hoarders &amp; speculators and less than the 7% for vacant site levy, which itself was useless. This is worse than useless compared to the radical action needed to unlock sites in hands if speculators

Clearly FG/FF are clashing on how precisely not to invest in solving the housing crisis! We don't need in-fighting on housing.

1410619560294858754	2021-07-01 15:21:25+00:00	The government promised that they would ensure that all the sites being transferred to the Land Development Agency would have 100% social and affordable housing on them if they were in Dublin and Galway.

1410612405340573696	2021-07-01 14:53:00+00:00	Latest announcement from the government about changes to rent increases not good enough!  Rents are already unsustainable and they need to be brought back to realistic levels that people can afford. @pb4p https://t.co/RIvJXKO720
1410497591624732672	2021-07-01 07:16:46+00:00	This measure is worse than useless and will do nothing to address the already extortionate and unaffordable level of rents. We need an urgent rent freeze and the introduction of rent controls to set rents at affordable levels &amp; real security for tenants @TommyMeskill @rtenews https://t.co/fswHt4chCb
1410212726748631042	2021-06-30 12:24:49+00:00	The government's plan for the Land Development Agency is a complete heist.  It will see the public land bank, handed over to the new Agency with no commitment for the land on those sites to be actually affordable. @pb4p https://t.co/rlF6ce8iQz

1407801740758597649	2021-06-23 20:44:25+00:00	FF/FG/Green Gov just voted down @pb4p amendments to Residential Tenancies Bill that would have protected tenants from 8% or 12% rent hikes on top of already shocking rents &amp; prevented unfair evictions at least until the pandemic is over.
