994500526191661056	2018-05-10 08:52:57+00:00	@ronanlupton @maryCyPsy @MaryLouMcDonald @Donnchadhol @ThomasByrneTD @timmydooley @BarryOSullivan I am referring to the LSE study. For clarity.
994497717454934016	2018-05-10 08:41:47+00:00	Parents of very young children thought 13 was ok. Parents of teens/ pre-teens opted for 16?? Correct me if I am wrong @maryCyPsy @BarryOSullivan ??? https://t.co/32NJSmA6p9
994347067421192193	2018-05-09 22:43:09+00:00	Thanks Mary. (With a lotta help from yourself and @BarryOSullivan to be fair. https://t.co/JaqCSNVC5P
994196742445961221	2018-05-09 12:45:49+00:00	My committee stage speech on the Case for the Digital Age of Consent at 16 https://t.co/Tvv2TEA6vM I have resubmitted my amendment for the report stage of this legislation @BarryOSullivan @maryCyPsy @labour
994117807213293568	2018-05-09 07:32:09+00:00	@blackwaterdunc1 Yesterday I asked which Minister has responsibility for school transport. It’s Mr. Halligan. So one isn’t hopeful of any shift in policy at this stage.
994108438367129600	2018-05-09 06:54:56+00:00	Tell me if this is a daft observation. Men’s profile pics on @Twitter tend to be action shots with both hands outstretched in the act of explaining/proselytising/ lecturing; women’s tend to be simple head shots.  Is there a deeper meaning in that I wonder??
994103469433851904	2018-05-09 06:35:11+00:00	@blackwaterdunc1 https://t.co/A2Q6QdGKhK good day time service to be fair

993940371179745280	2018-05-08 19:47:05+00:00	@C103fm @TheAvondhu FG in County Cork are going to have some fun trying to spin their way out of this one positively. Only 3 Local Link routes in the entire county ‘announced’ on Ross’ new drink-link list. https://t.co/o4hUOxYUTh
993919567188713473	2018-05-08 18:24:25+00:00	@TheHarryMcC No. thanks. please feel free to send me an email sean.sherlock@oir.ie kind regards.
993914214241751040	2018-05-08 18:03:09+00:00	I feel a full Dáil vote in me waters on this. Perhaps not where FF wanted to be on this methinks.  Will let the historians judge that though. https://t.co/up9RBb4L31
993910551788089346	2018-05-08 17:48:36+00:00	@BarryOSullivan @insight_centre @UCC @timmydooley @ThomasByrneTD @Donnchadhol Have just resubmitted my original ‘16’ amendment.
993909089838215168	2018-05-08 17:42:47+00:00	@RCPI_news @CharlieFlanagan @DenisNaughten @timmydooley @Dept_CCAE Some of these issues were raised by me @ 2nd stage in Dail with help from Prof. @BarryOSullivan. So if the tech sector ‘libertarians’ aren’t lobbying for 13. + we have real doctors + real profs of computer science + SM companies themselves opting for 16 then Govt has to listen??

993826636511531008	2018-05-08 12:15:09+00:00	A thread worth reading. You can legislate for many things but (as a very wise man once told me) ‘you can’t legislate for ignorance son!’ #Empathy https://t.co/bdhbjKD8T7
993760647367323648	2018-05-08 07:52:56+00:00	Did I hear S Ross on @morningireland earlier saying that no applications came from Co. Cork for pilot scheme ?? Happy to be corrected on that ??? @AvonBlack @Corkcoco https://t.co/A44wjhaafU
993410429601964032	2018-05-07 08:41:17+00:00	@EoinBearla @PaircUiCha0imh @GardaTraffic I was one of the reluctants (that’s what I meant) .  And amen to your response. He’s the real deal. And he was on Jools so that’s good enough for me.
993407442745688064	2018-05-07 08:29:25+00:00	Fair Play to all. Enjoyed that.  Was one of the @EoinBearla ‘reluctants’ . Great Buzz. Impressive Traffic management @PaircUiCha0imh @GardaTraffic + local community #Edcork

989268196875276288	2018-04-25 22:21:32+00:00	@fiannafailparty @MichealMartinTD Why didn’t you guys support @SenatorMcDowell amendment in Seanad then? Or even speak to the issue at second stage in Dail last week?
989264508832055296	2018-04-25 22:06:53+00:00	@D2LMallow Thanks a million.  Very well organised!!!
989263673481924608	2018-04-25 22:03:34+00:00	@BenSlimm Who’s restricting anyone’s right to access information? That’s not what this is about at all.  Wherever did you pick that up???
989149198468698112	2018-04-25 14:28:41+00:00	@maryCyPsy @MichealMartinTD @timmydooley @AnneRabbitte @OCallaghanJim @ThomasByrneTD @BarryOSullivan I’d like to think that We played some part in shifting the narrative on this. (Before the historical narrative is revised).  You can check my speech at second stage  in The Dail.  FF and SF didn’t actually mention supporting the DAOC at 16 last week at 2nd stage.
989146329229209600	2018-04-25 14:17:16+00:00	It’s so important to check you are registered to vote in the upcoming referendum; supplementary register is open until May8th. Visit https://t.co/EqkZIq8nK5 , visit your local library or call my office and be sure to have your say on 25th May. https://t.co/LlZoRo1vko
988894069286981633	2018-04-24 21:34:53+00:00	Prof Louise Kenny, a consultant OBGYN, “of the 3,265 Irish women and girls who had a termination in the UK in 2016, 66 were aged 17 or under, and 10 were under 16. These children of Ireland deserve compassion and care.” That’s one of many reasons why I am voting yes #men4yes
988891940497297409	2018-04-24 21:26:25+00:00	@Donal_OKeeffe @daithigor @anyciar No joy Donal. Mallow people will make up their own minds on this though. Sheer Bad manners are never forgotten.

988725841290039297	2018-04-24 10:26:24+00:00	Speaking now to @pmessy #CorkToday @C103Cork re the Digital Age of Consent. I am taking guidance from experts like @BarryOSullivan on the issue and 13 is too young to issue data permissions @labour
988706601396850689	2018-04-24 09:09:57+00:00	@Ballynamona @ClaireByrneLive Something very ‘quixotic’ about it all.  #surreal
988540200375767040	2018-04-23 22:08:44+00:00	@BarryOSullivan @LawUCC @UCC Can I get in on that conversation please??

988467904327938048	2018-04-23 17:21:27+00:00	@D2LMallow If people have registered online and have received their t-shirts is it still necessary to show proof of registration on the night/morning? Thanks.
988411174403309569	2018-04-23 13:36:02+00:00	@LaceyDermot @jackpowerIT I accept that.  But the invitation was issued and accepted.
988401172192120832	2018-04-23 12:56:17+00:00	I am now suspicious that we are not being told the full story. Why meet the minister last week and then refuse to meet the committee this week. It’s not being taken lightly by some of  the Members of the Dail, including myself. 2/2 @jackpowerIT
988401082475966464	2018-04-23 12:55:56+00:00	IMHO, it would have been better for @ScoutingIreland to have attended meeting Oireachtas committee this Wed.Notwithstanding content of letter explaining non attendance, it does create a poor impression &amp; suggests there may be a lot more to this than meets the eye @jackpowerIT 1/2
987747076166610945	2018-04-21 17:37:09+00:00	@TFYMitchelstown Sure thing.  Will follow to dm
987024941974523905	2018-04-19 17:47:38+00:00	@SarahBardon To be fair to @jackpowerIT myself and @AnneRabbitte might not necessarily have raised this on the floor of the Dáil today.  This will no doubt be aired further within the Children and Youth Affairs Cttee.  Watch this space.
