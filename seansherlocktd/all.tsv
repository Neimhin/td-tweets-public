988401082475966464	2018-04-23 12:55:56+00:00	IMHO, it would have been better for @ScoutingIreland to have attended meeting Oireachtas committee this Wed.Notwithstanding content of letter explaining non attendance, it does create a poor impression &amp; suggests there may be a lot more to this than meets the eye @jackpowerIT 1/2
988401172192120832	2018-04-23 12:56:17+00:00	I am now suspicious that we are not being told the full story. Why meet the minister last week and then refuse to meet the committee this week. It‚Äôs not being taken lightly by some of  the Members of the Dail, including myself. 2/2 @jackpowerIT

If @IrishRail introduces pre-booking for peak hours it‚Äôs hard to see how it would work, judging by the number of empty pre-booked seats that I witness weekly.

One wonders now if the Commission itself leaked the original report? The survivors have been sacrificed again on the altar of ‚Äúgetting ahead and controlling the narrative‚Äù.
