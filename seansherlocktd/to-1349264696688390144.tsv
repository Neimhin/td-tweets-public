There's a long way to go before you could describe the road as being fit for purpose. It clearly isn't at present. https://t.co/8PAkmoyFpk

1351992558910664704	2021-01-20 20:38:39+00:00	The timeframe for enhanced medical cards should be considered because anyone who spent even an hour in such an institution should have that right.

1351873420024311808	2021-01-20 12:45:14+00:00	@myowngaffe Not saying anyone should jump queue.  I said that in the interview; that vulnerable and older people have to be looked after as a priority.  A greater supply of vaccine would allow us to get through every cohort that needs it. But we don‚Äôt have timelines for supply.
1351869027241627648	2021-01-20 12:27:47+00:00	We need to ensure that a teacher can go back into a safe environment, that the parent feels that they're safe, the student feels they are safe &amp; the only way you do that, I think, is ensuring that you have an adequate supply of the vaccine @labour https://t.co/XoVZSedT0n
