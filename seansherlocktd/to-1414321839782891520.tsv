That support is crucial for families facing the coming winter. https://t.co/lnSDsW4c5T https://t.co/Jb4q4XHbGX

That person is waiting for a callback. This has gone too far.  Gov cannot ignore this now - It needs to be dealt with

I recognise the value of a beast and of a blade of grass as much as the next person.  I recognise the value of what farming brings to this economy.  @labour https://t.co/LuBU6EPBfS

And you can't even be sure whether or not you’ll to get an ambulance anymore. https://t.co/j1anikVuw8

The ‘charge on the revenue’ argument was used to rule the amendment OOO.  If successful it could have dealt with greater diversity in planting. https://t.co/BxQhWksCnC
