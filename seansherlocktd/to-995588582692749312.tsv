This decision flies in the face of over ‚Ç¨29 million investment in lower harbour in clean renewable energy and flies in the face of every family in Cobh and throughout the Lower Harbour @CHASECorkNews https://t.co/MIR3XqkIfU

1000110889360592898	2018-05-25 20:26:31+00:00	@dearbhlalenehan @Corkcoco There was an agreement in the days of the town council. This continues to respected by all during D√°il and Council elections. There is no by-law prohibiting posters to my knowledge. So the long standing agreement was breached. In a very disrespectful way.

We now have a situation where the Dail voted to facilitate 17 people to a 13 person committee. The Ross effect! Makes a joke of the new process on appointments of judges. Fallout to follow tomorrow on this.
