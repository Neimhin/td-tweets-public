We deal with them every day of the week. I reiterate the call that has been made that the process and outcome have to be meaningful https://t.co/FJYxqkCFH0

1410896572972404738	2021-07-02 09:42:10+00:00	No evidence of hesitancy amongst young people to get a vaccine.  Young people are very responsible about their own health. The notion that the State should spend millions paying young people to get a vaccine patronises young people and diminishes them.

It speaks volumes about the fact that, from an ideological point of view, this Government and its component parts still believe that the market alone will deliver housing.@labour https://t.co/y6HZeeLUtU
1405115578608762880	2021-06-16 10:50:34+00:00	There is an opportunity here, in the here and the now, to address the issue of housing. It is the issue of our time and of our generation as politicians and I'm disappointed that the Minister has come to us with this response of 12 month deferral @labour https://t.co/ss2W1eSppZ

We all look back+ think we should have handled certain situations differently. Some of us learn from our experience. But right now , this is only about thousands of women who continue to be wronged. https://t.co/WlJWJy6bnK

1403405750597304326	2021-06-11 17:36:19+00:00	@PatsyMcGarryIT @MaryERegan @rodericogorman @rtenews What‚Äôs ‚Äònot true‚Äô Patsy? That the Commission leaked the letter to The Irish Times before the Oireachtas Committee took receipt of it ? 1/2
1403372067114864642	2021-06-11 15:22:28+00:00	@MaryERegan @rodericogorman @rtenews So this went to @PatsyMcGarryIT before going to the Oireachtas.  One wonders now if the Commission itself leaked the original report? The survivors have been sacrificed again on the altar of ‚Äúgetting ahead and controlling the narrative‚Äù.  Unedifying and unethical.

1400357612206628864	2021-06-03 07:44:06+00:00	Compelling intervention by @maireadenright @morningireland . As a Member of the Oireachtas Children‚Äôs Cttee , it is jarring that the Commission refused to come b‚Äôfore our Cttee to explain their findings.  Oxford fallout cannot be ignored and must be addressed by @rodericogorman

1400208965682839556	2021-06-02 21:53:26+00:00	Voting for @PearseDoherty bill was a genuine opportunity for a breakthrough. All opposition parties supported it.  It shouldn‚Äôt be a partisan issue. Government trying to kill a good piece of legislation with ‚Äòkindness‚Äô by kicking to touch is a charade. https://t.co/7Vq8iub6KP
1400179704884338699	2021-06-02 19:57:10+00:00	@triciaosull That argument was completely deconstructed by me subsequently, with raw data.  Then they put the Metropolitan Plan up as a barrier.  And now government seems to be putting loss of revenue up as an argument.  Bottom line here is Will.  Where there is a Will there is a way.
1400100025796120580	2021-06-02 14:40:33+00:00	Excellent point https://t.co/pftAcYuu3Z
1400087014255517696	2021-06-02 13:48:51+00:00	I feel it's only right and proper and fair that rail users in Mallow who travel to Cork should have the same pricing structure, as somebody who lives in the Dublin Metropolitan area. Fairness is what we're after. @labour https://t.co/KgLmQcJ1oM
