I understand Public Health feel masks should be retained in schools and on public transport etc until the end of February, the reasoning is people choose to go to pubs, kids are obliged to go to school.

1484150868660391943	2022-01-20 13:08:35+00:00	@jm_pas_les_gens Thanks for the feedback. I can see the benefit of a summer BH, perhaps in July. But there was a strong push for St. Brigid's Day, there is a long gap from NY to St. Patrick's Day. TBF all workers will benefit, with a day off, in lieu, or extra pay.
