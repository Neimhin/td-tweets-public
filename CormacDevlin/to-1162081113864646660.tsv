1189818567644139520	2019-10-31 08:17:06+00:00	While this is welcome, it is too little, too late for the current day commuters who must contend with over crowded carriages in Dublin &amp; across Ireland. This has been raised by @fiannafailparty over the last number of years but Govt only responded when PrineTime covered it. https://t.co/RdgQ4cA1nS

They've clearly listened to the public. There are some areas that will need tweaking. I encourage people to check the plan for their area on https://t.co/DFX1iFAj0g https://t.co/l202G7klhj
1186656487315329024	2019-10-22 14:52:08+00:00	@fiannafailparty @BusConnects @HolyChildCS @SCFEOfficial @GraduateDublin @romafooddublin @loughlinstown Thirdy, #BusConnects now propose to retain the 7D (as the 312), as a peak-time service linking #Dalkey, #Glenageary and #Sallynoggin with #UCD and on to the city. This is a significant u-turn and really welcome for students and commuters in this area👍 https://t.co/gW3cI3jde0
1186653918090203136	2019-10-22 14:41:55+00:00	@fiannafailparty @BusConnects @HolyChildCS @SCFEOfficial @GraduateDublin Secondly, #BusConnects are proposing to retain the direct route (No. 7) from Loughlinstown Park to the City Centre (calling it the 98). This is a significant change and really welcome. But the hourly frequency is insufficient, so there's more work to be done. https://t.co/m3lAFpkArb
1186652896840114178	2019-10-22 14:37:52+00:00	@fiannafailparty @BusConnects Some key takeaways from the new #BusConnects proposals:   First off, some great news for #Sallynoggin - a new high frequency service B4 will commence from the Graduate, linking Sallynoggin with the City Centre every 10-15 minutes. This is a significant upgrade in service 👍 https://t.co/JRdQb0rAgT
1186619980714074112	2019-10-22 12:27:04+00:00	Attending #BusConnects briefing on the revised proposals for the Dublin bus network.

Clearly some parts of Dublin are more profitable than others. A Dublin-wide scheme (supported by the NTA &amp; 4 authorities) might get around some of the issues now being cited.
1184196924951453696	2019-10-15 19:58:42+00:00	IT's @OliviaKellyIT reports on #Bleeperbike decision to remove services from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown on Friday 18th October.
