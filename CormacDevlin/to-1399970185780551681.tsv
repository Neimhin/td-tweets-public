1428789780779868174	2021-08-20 18:43:24+00:00	@therealhughesie Hi Brian, I suggested four options to improve the scheme, while also keeping the bus route. Two involved segregated cycle lanes on Deansgrange Road and two other options (which should be implemented anyway). There's a lot of misinformation being circulated I'm afraid.

Two involved segregated cycle lanes on Deansgrange Road and two other options (which should be implemented anyway). There's a lot of misinformation being circulated I'm afraid.
1428788555107680256	2021-08-20 18:38:31+00:00	@lisa_mcaree Hi Lisa, thanks for your feedback. I support investment in safer cycling infrastructure. Unfortunately there is a lot of misinformation circulating. My recent D√°il remarks outline my views https://t.co/od2d1YPxZe
1428774248647168010	2021-08-20 17:41:40+00:00	@finianmurphy @barrymward Any of these 4 options would allow a two-way bus service continue. Bus Connects proposes routes on Deansgrange Road and Abbey Road (high frequency B4), they are important to people living in the area. But I accept that's not a priority for everyone. https://t.co/bYdqu5QqKh
1428773521480732676	2021-08-20 17:38:47+00:00	@finianmurphy @barrymward I proposed 4 options: 1 Remove parking on cemetery side to create the segregated lane 2 Engineering changes (which would probably involve a HGV ban) to create a the segregated lane 3 Route per Deansgrange Area Plan 4 Upgrading Link Road / Abbey Road (which should be done anyway)
1428771829540343810	2021-08-20 17:32:04+00:00	@CraptainP @smytho @RBoydBarrett I checked this out, I'm told revised guidelines were issued on 19 August 2021 and no one will be excluded from the transplant list, the usual risk/benefit assessments will continue to be carried out if a donor becomes available.
1428769108556976141	2021-08-20 17:21:15+00:00	@finianmurphy @barrymward The issue is to be examined at the next DLR Council meeting, I would encourage everyone to have their say and engage with Councillors in advance of the meeting. They can be reached at https://t.co/FhKkDCgTwW
1428768721200373775	2021-08-20 17:19:43+00:00	@finianmurphy @barrymward Feedback on the AST was very favorable, but bus users, local schools &amp; residents highlighted issues with the Deansgrange Rd aspect. I proposed a number of changes that would allow the cycle lane go ahead on the route &amp; also other alternatives (which need upgrading anyway)
1428767782594916355	2021-08-20 17:15:59+00:00	@finianmurphy @barrymward I welcomed the Active School Travel proposal, held an online public meeting to detail the benefits &amp; get feedback. I called for it to go further highlighting a number of schools that needed safe infrastructure (Castle Park Dalkey, St Kevin's Sallynoggin &amp; others)
1428766915296628742	2021-08-20 17:12:32+00:00	@finianmurphy @barrymward Myself &amp; @barrymward have supported projects like the the Sutton to Sandycove #S2S coastal route for years. It is regrettable DLR officials have proposed to remove it from the new County Development Plan. We need to make the coast even more accessible https://t.co/pqvO3GbQtE
1428765506136416263	2021-08-20 17:06:56+00:00	@finianmurphy @barrymward Hi Fintan, thanks for your feedback. Its great to see everyone young &amp; old enjoying the coast. I support investment in safer cycling infrastructure. Unfortunately there is a lot of misinformation circulating. My recent D√°il remarks outline my views  https://t.co/od2d1YPxZe
1428492759980204034	2021-08-19 23:03:08+00:00	@brendanjoseph_ @TheJohnnieCraig I appreciate people have their priorities and that's to be expected, the Council also have a job to do but many of their plans have been very light on detail about the impact on bus users. In some cases they omitted any reference to certain routes.
1428489905492172800	2021-08-19 22:51:48+00:00	@TheJohnnieCraig You are right, apologies. The last reply was on 5th August, the original was issued on Fri 23rd. Cllrs were briefed by email the same night
1428486602242809858	2021-08-19 22:38:40+00:00	@brendanjoseph_ Thanks Brendan, I will certainly take a look at DRT options. Hopefully it's something that can be examined at the Climate Action Committee. I appreciate your feedback on the issue.
1428486067498409984	2021-08-19 22:36:33+00:00	@TheJohnnieCraig During the Zoom meeting people suggested a number of alternatives options. I included four in my own submission to officials (two alternative routes &amp; two engineering solutions) any of the four would have kept the bus route. But I accept that's not a priority for everyone (2/2)
1428485127265558528	2021-08-19 22:32:48+00:00	@TheJohnnieCraig Thanks Johnnie, that's an email I sent on 5th August to update people who attended a Zoom meeting on the issue and asked for updates. It must have been sent on to Brookville/Springhill Residents. I haven't sent any letters to residents. (1/2)
1428480277135900677	2021-08-19 22:13:32+00:00	@TheJohnnieCraig Thanks Johnnie, do send it on and I will check (cormac@cormacdevlin.ie). Cllrs were only briefed on 5th August, so that sounds odd
1428478963312218114	2021-08-19 22:08:19+00:00	@brendanjoseph_ The proposed L26 and L27 routes critical services for the area, not just Deansgrange Road. Given the significant new development in Cabinteely - Glenamuck I will be pressing for increased frequencies for these routes. Orbital connections are a major issue in DLR
1428477032539824137	2021-08-19 22:00:39+00:00	@TheJohnnieCraig @RBoydBarrett @smytho Yes
1428476542322106372	2021-08-19 21:58:42+00:00	@TheJohnnieCraig Perhaps you are mistaking me with one of the other reps who sent a letter? I haven't issued any letter to the area. Like most reps I've received hundreds of emails, I've referenced the alternative options I proposed for the segregated cycle route in my replies.
1428470535470583816	2021-08-19 21:34:50+00:00	@TheJohnnieCraig @RBoydBarrett @smytho Thanks for the feedback Johnnie, the article is misleading, remarks were omitted and an editorial slant put on the content &amp; headlines. I support sustainable travel options. I have suggested several alternatives that would ensure the area has safe segregated cycle lanes.
1428468334425776138	2021-08-19 21:26:05+00:00	@brendanjoseph_ Good access to bus services is critical, particularly if we want to give people alternatives. Bus Connects proposes two-way routes on Deansgrange Road &amp; Abbey Road (high frequency). They should proceed in my view, but I appreciate some people have different priorities. https://t.co/liXwj17bsQ
1428464493286281219	2021-08-19 21:10:49+00:00	@brendanjoseph_ Removing a bus route from the area is problematic, particularly given the older profile of the population. I suggested other options (removing parking) to keep the route in place &amp; allow a segregated cycle lane. The issue has become very divisive &amp; misinformation is circulating
1428450192198615040	2021-08-19 20:13:59+00:00	@CraptainP Nope, wasn't invited
1428447882890330113	2021-08-19 20:04:49+00:00	@daveyius Hi David, thanks for the feedback. I support investment in green infrastructure. I have suggested a number of options to improve safety that go well beyond what was proposed. Unfortunately the article is very misleading.
1428446767155224579	2021-08-19 20:00:23+00:00	@brendanjoseph_ Hi Brendan, thanks for the feedback. Removing northbound buses is an issue for bus users in the area. I suggested several alternatives that would allow a safe segregated cycle lane. A HGV transit ban could be an option (I will raise with with FF cllrs).
